Just looking through my unwatched horror blu-rays (and there are quite a few), I started wondering if I had enough of a distribution over release years to get a good sample of horror spanning many decades.  What I came up with was this: starting from 1960 up until 2019, I would pick one movie from each two-year period.  So one movie from 1960-1961, one from 1962-1963, and so on all the way to one from 2018-2019.  Doing the math, that comes out to 30 movies from 1960 to 2019, 5 per decade.  I’m going to start at the beginning and work my way up so that I get a good journey through horror history.  When picking movies, my criteria for choosing:",

With 30 movies, it’ll be an interesting journey!",

        "In browsing my Letterboxd list of owned movies on Blu-ray to come up with a new watchlist, I started noticing that I had only watched some of a lot of movie series.  Of course, that kind of bugs me from a completionist point of view, so we must put an end to it.  When I broke it down, I saw that most were horror (of course..) and there were several non-horror series.  Rather than try to make one large watchlist, I decided I would split it out and do just the horror series this time.  I suppose that leaves me with a freebie watchlist sometime in the future for non-horror.<br><br>Generally, what I am aiming for is a series where I still have at least a couple of unwatched movies.  The series may have more movies than I own, so I’m just “finishing” the series as far as my collection is concerned.  There may even be a few instances where I only have one movie left to watch, but I’ll allow it.  I make the rules here.<br><br>In organizing the list, I counted 23 movies.  That’s a pretty fair number for a watchlist.  So far, the watchlist lengths have been 70, 21, 12, 10, 32, 25.. so this is smack in the middle.  Fair.  This will stretch all the way from the 1940s to the 2010s, so we should get some pretty good variety!",

Anyway, when I presented the theme, I said there’d be 23 movies.  Well, that was a lie.

I do have some movies queued up for a Finish the Series Non-Horror edition, but I don’t know that I want to jump right back into the land of sequels right away.  I’ve got some other ideas up my sleeve for what’s next.  Interesting thing though, the 4th movie of the next playlist will be #200 overall since I started this thing.  Pretty wild.  I guess that’s about a 250 movie-per-year pace.  If I kept that up, and at the rate that I buy new movies, maybe I’d watch everything I own by 2025.. but who knows, that’s not really the point.

I wouldn’t call any of them bad, I just thought there’d be one or two that really stood out</li><li><strong>Classic Action</strong> – Avg: 7.4 – On the flipside, this was more of a pleasant surprise.  As not much of an action kind of guy, I still go into most of these and will rewatch some of these again</li><li><strong>Heavy Drama</strong> – Avg: 8.1 – Not really fair to the other categories because this one was stacked.  I knew before I started watching these movies that the top movies would come out of this category and I knew <strong>Marriage Story</strong> would be up my alley.  Unfortunately it was the very last movie of the watchlist, so I had to wait a while</li>",

Maybe I was looking for something different than what this movie was</li><li><strong>Silent Running</strong> – It seems like it could have been great to me, but I feel like this movie was supposed to be “saying” something but it wasn’t really?</li><li><strong>Wizards</strong> – Cool animation, although very inconsistent styles.. but sometimes the animation and voice work just went together too awkwardly</li>",

I had options for sci-fi that takes itself fairly seriously or ones where you accept the cheese factor and just go with it.. so I went with the more serious ones this time</li><li><strong>“Classic” Action</strong> – Action isn’t really one of my top genres.. I’m like a Horror, Drama, Sci-Fi.. then Comedy and Action.  So there are some older action movies that most people have seen and I just never got around to them.  An alternate title for this category could be “manly” action.. since these probably have male-heavy fanbases.  These movies will put hair on your chest, even if you’re a woman</li><li><strong>“Heavy” Drama</strong> – There’s that word again.. heavy.  Why are things so heavy in the future?  When picking the drama movies, I decided to focus on ones that probably are a little heavier emotionally for one reason or another instead of something that borders more like, say, drama-thriller</li>",
        "I lined up five movies to watch in each category, ending with the heavier drama before I go back into the wacky world of horror, camp and cheese.  As always, I’ll keep track of my ratings and see how things shake out in the end.  I suspect these ratings will be much higher than my previous watchlists.  As much as I love watching those old forgotten horror movies from the 70s and 80s.. a lot of them are forgotten for a reason.

These movies are enjoyable all the way through and are those “stranded on an island” movies.. the movies I’d take if I were to be left on some island for years with nothing else to watch but those.  What puts them above something like a 9-9.5 is that these have some personal meaning or something I associate my identity with in addition to just being a good movie.  I don’t give something a 10 right away either.. it takes time for me to know if a movie is in that category, so most of my 10s are older movies",

          "<strong>8-8.5</strong> – Really good movies that I plan on watching again.  They have some minor flaws, maybe they drag at some point or they take a wrong turn somewhere, but they are still undeniably good",
          "<strong>7-7.5</strong> – Good but only engaging in bursts.  For me, it’s a movie where I can say “oh I liked that part and that part” or “the cast was good and it was pretty well-made, but I lost interest a little here and there”",
          "<strong>6-6.5</strong> – Above average.  Not really bad, has some merit or entertainment value, but just not really consistently entertaining enough to hold my attention",

          "<strong>4-4.5</strong> – Below average.  Usually a combination of low quality and bad writing/acting.  Some of these have heart and effort in them but the filmmaking is just not good",

          "<strong>2-2.5</strong> – Really bad.  These are movies I’m kind of annoyed I even took the time to watch.  I almost never give anything this low of a rating because most movies have some respectable or redeemable aspects to them",

It’s hard to watch someone in such a bad mental state, but I feel like it was really well-portrayed</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – More Fessenden.  I mentioned it earlier but it’s an interesting take on destructive habits/relationships</li><li><strong>Hearts in Atlantis</strong> – Great acting and a story that I kind of “get” as a Stephen King/Dark Tower fan</li><li><strong>Ringu</strong> – Not as impactful as it could be since I already knew the major points from the American remake, but still well-made</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – If there was a bit more explanation and “glue” in the movie, it would have been one of the top two or three.  It’s basically an American giallo that gets pretty extreme</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – The more I think about this one, the more fondly I remember it.

The obvious thing here.. a lot of Larry Fessenden in the final rounds.. but somehow a comedy horror movie broke through.  Even though <strong>The Editor</strong> was my pick for the overall winner, I think the real takeaway for me is that I dig Larry Fessenden’s movies and that was totally unexpected.",
        "<strong>Categories</strong>",
        "Let’s take a look at each category, starting with my highest rated and working down (with the average rating in parentheses):",
        "<li><strong>Larry Fessenden</strong> – (7.88) – I will definitely seek out other movies of his after this.  I bought the Larry Fessenden set from Scream Factory as a completionist type thing and only decided to watch them for this watchlist.  Really glad I did.  Habit and Wendigo were both great and the other two were still good</li><li><strong>Comedy Horror </strong>– (6.75) – Not really expected at all, especially when I started with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.. but in spite of that one, the other three were all really entertaining, even if a little cheesy/campy at times.  Three of them made it to round three, which is really good</li><li><strong>Giallo</strong> – (6.75) – Well, this was the same rating as the comedies, but I give the edge to comedies due to the winner coming out of that group and the fact that so many ended up in the top 8 movies.  But the giallos (or gialli I’ve learned) were really consistent.  None of them were bad but none of them were really amazing.  When I throw on a giallo, I pretty much know that I’m getting a mystery with a Euro vibe and I enjoy that</li><li><strong>Hammer</strong> – (6.50) – Like the giallo category, these were all pretty similar and consistent.  I like these movies more based on the monster and, when the main monster is kind of weak, I’m less interested in the movie.  The werewolf and the phantom were more interesting and the two vampire movies were just.. eh</li><li><strong>Universal </strong>– (6.13) – A couple weaker movies in the bunch, but otherwise ok.  Not much to say, but the highlight for me was Tower of London, even though it was not really horror at all</li><li><strong>Millennial</strong> – (6.00) – It started off ok with Valentine and Joy Ride, but Thir13en Ghosts and Ghost Ship didn’t age so well.  Part of the fun of watching these is re-living the ~2000 era so I got that out of these movies, even if they weren’t really good movies</li><li><strong>80s Slashers</strong> – (5.38) – I like 80s slashers.. I do.  But I think I’ve seen most of the good ones already, so these random ones I pluck from my boutique labels are not really top-tier stuff.  Like some of these other categories, they are a predictable and comfortable watch, but the quality and budget are usually both pretty low</li><li><strong>HG Lewis</strong> – (5.13) – The first one was Two Thousand Maniacs and I kind of liked it (it made it to round 3, but coming out of a weak sub-group), but after that, it just fell apart.  I get that the gore was revolutionary at the time, but the movies themselves are just too cheap feeling, similar to Al Adamson’s movies but.. not quite that bad</li>",

        "<li><strong>The Editor </strong>– A lot of fun and a good homage to some very specific types of movies</li><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – Slow and not a lot of “horror” but something in the setting and family drama clicked with me</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – A cool look into a guy’s life in early 90s NYC but with a horror/monster slant to it</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – While first watching, I felt like “do I like this or not..?” but after finishing the movie and thinking about it, I enjoyed it.  It’s just entertaining all the way through</li><li><strong>The Last Winter</strong> – I was disappointed that this wasn’t the obvious favorite, only because I was hyped up from the other Fessenden movies, but I still really liked the setup and it was mostly well-made</li>",

        "<strong>The Groups</strong>",
        "I thought of this “tournament” as four smaller groups of eight, with each winner making it to the final four.  Just for fun, let’s look at the average rating of each:",
        "<li><strong>Group 1</strong> – (6.06) – The weakest group, mainly because it had my least favorite Universal, Hammer and Comedy movies of the bunch</li><li><strong>Group 2</strong> – (6.44) – A bit better thanks to Habit, Elvira and Joy Ride, plus my favorite of the Universal bunch, Tower of London</li><li><strong>Group 3 </strong>– (6.63) – Easily the best group, containing two of my top five: Wendigo and Serial Mom</li><li><strong>Group 4</strong> – (6.13) – Surprisingly weak considering it had my top movie, The Editor, but almost everything else was just so-so (except The Last Winter)</li>",

Instead of a bracket size of 64, I’m going to stay sane and go with 32 movies.  Since I don’t plan on watching a movie a day, I decided to start it in February to give myself a couple months to get through the list.",

        "I split them up into four groups, each group has one of each category.  Then the tournament seeds were randomized.. so in one group, there might be an HG Lewis movie vs a Universal, another group maybe Universal vs 80s slasher, etc.  I randomized because I want variety, but I hope that gives me some good matchups, too.  So after I watch a pair of movies, I will determine my favorite of the two and that will be the one who “advances”.  After watching all 32 movies, I will have the 16 winners and then go through the rest of the bracket to see which movie wins my admiration and affection.  Looking at the list of movies, I don’t really know what to expect.. I don’t see any movies I expect to really like and I don’t see any I expect to hate.  I’m hopeful there will be a few (good) surprises in there.  And as always, I look forward to seeing and analyzing the results.  I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me.",

It could have been fleshed out a little more, though</li><li><strong>The Plague of the Zombies – </strong>This had the ingredients of being great to me, mainly an outsider coming into a place where there is something mysterious going on (spoiler: zombies).. and the zombies looked fairly creepy.  If we had gotten more zombie time and less village drama time, it could have been a pretty good time</li>",

Pretty uninspired, feels like a lot of other 2000s/2010s supernatural movies aimed at teens.  Not even sure I would have liked it as a teenager</li><li><strong>Dynamite Brothers – </strong>I feel bad putting this in the worst list as it wasn’t SO bad, especially for an Al Adamson movie.  It’s obviously slapped together to try to make money off of current trends and the quality is pretty low, but it’s a couple of guys kung fu-ing some criminals in the 70s, how can you not like that a little bit?</li>",

I have over 1800 movies total (in any format – VHS, DVD or Blu-ray) and almost 670 of those are unwatched.

For example, Godzilla movies will probably be grouped together in at least one watchlist someday, so I’d discard those here.

A couple of these were more in the drama camp and another more in action, so I liked those first two a bit better.</li><li><strong>Japanese Action</strong> – [Average: <strong>6.83/10</strong>] These also happened to be Arrow releases.  Ratings-wise, they were pretty much identical to the Arrow Crime movies for me, but I just liked a couple of those Arrow Crime movies a little bit more.</li><li><strong>Stephen King Non-Horror</strong> – [Average: <strong>6.67/10</strong>] About what I expected.. some decent drama and good stories, but not quite the level of my favorite Stephen King movies.</li><li><strong>De Niro + De Palma</strong> – [Average: <strong>5.83/10</strong>] Being such early films of De Palma, they were a little rough.  Interesting most of the time but.. not quite my style.  I could see the improvement by the end though.</li><li><strong>Christmas Horror</strong> – [Average: <strong>5.17/10</strong>] Yeah.. I didn’t expect too much out of this theme, but I got that Christmas horror warm fuzzies at least (well, from two of the movies anyway)</li><li><strong>Is it THAT Bad..?</strong> – [Average: <strong>4.17/10</strong>] I know, this isn’t fair but.. these are the numbers.  Honestly, I was expecting the average score for these three to be something like a 3/10, so the fact that it was over 4 is a surprise.  I’m a little disappointed since I was expecting to be blown away (in a bad way, I guess..) but was just underwhelmed by the movies.</li>",

        "Most movies in here were somewhere in between “eh” and “not bad”.  Here are my top 3:",
        "<li><strong>Hearts in Atlantis</strong> – Felt like classic Stephen King so that kind sealed the deal from the beginning for me</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – Basically an 80s slasher dressed in a crime thriller dressed in S&amp;M leathers.. it was interesting and that means bonus points from me.  I think the only drawback was that it felt like pieces were missing, so things didn’t really tie together so well in the end</li><li><strong>Alamo</strong> – I know this is kind of a rose-colored glasses American pat-yourself-on-the-back movie, but still I can’t help but like the characters and the overall story of the Alamo</li>",
        "Now for the bottom 6.  Why 6?  Because I feel it’s a little unfair with the “THAT bad?” theme.  Those three are of course all near the bottom of the barrel, so let’s mix in three others that were a disappointment, starting with the worst:",
        "<li><strong>Carnival Magic</strong> – Really, the main problem for me is just that it was mostly boring.  But yeah, the acting, story and overall tone were not good either but.. those could be forgiven if it was more eventful</li><li><strong>Garbage Pail Kids</strong> – In the end, it’s pretty much a typical kids movie format, except the “kids” are just gross, but not in a funny way, just a.. stupid way</li><li><strong>Silent Night Deadly Night 4: The Initiation</strong> – This isn’t even from the “THAT bad?” theme.  This movie was some OK moments but is otherwise not interesting and, worst of all, not even really Christmas-themed.. the ultimate sin</li><li><strong>Hold Your Breath</strong> – Surprisingly, this isn’t even in the bottom 3.  I really expected it to be.. and it is bad, for sure, I really don’t like the writing or the characters or the acting.  But, if you don’t take it too seriously, the story is fun in a cheesy way</li><li><strong>Dolan’s Cadillac</strong> – The short story didn’t really need to be a full-length movie and I really felt like they could have gotten a better lead actor.. but bonus points for Christian Slater adding in just enough crazy to make it memorable</li><li><strong>The Wedding Party</strong> – It’s not that this is poorly made or anything, but it definitely felt like a student film and the style and the comedy just didn’t do it for me</li>",
        "So that’s that.  Definitely not as memorable as the Halloween watchlist, but of course, that’s a special time and I really focused on watching a lot of movies for those two months (yeah Halloween is a two-month holiday for me, so what?)  One of the bigger changes that I did this time around is incorporated non-blu ray formats (DVD and VHS) into the list.  While I’d prefer to focus on getting through my blu ray backlog, sometimes you have to squeeze in the others just to fill out enough movies for a theme.  And sometimes watching cheesy 90s horror is only right when its on VHS.",
        "I imagine I will do a similar thing to this one.  I already have a spreadsheet of possible future themes organized (I’m cool, I know, you don’t have to tell me).  So maybe I’ll just draw from that list.. or maybe I’ll pull from some bigger collections that I need to get through.. we’ll see!",

        "I already miss the watchlist.  I think back on those carefree days when I was just 35 and 8 months and I wonder how I withered into this old man of 35 and 9 months.  So my plan is to start a new watchlist for the rest of the year.  The plan is to still do themes and movies I own but still haven’t watched, but instead of weekly themes with bonus movies when there is extra time left in the week, I am just going with three movies per theme.  When those three are over, move on to the next three.  Also, with Halloween season sadly over, these are <em>mostly </em>not horror, so I have a chance to catch up on some other genres in my backlog.  I’m not trying to squeeze in so many this time, so I’m thinking 7 themes, 21 movies total.  Over the course of the rest of November and December, that’s still less than a movie every other day, so not too much pressure.  I have to save time to watch the traditional holiday classics like <strong>Jack Frost</strong> <strong>(1997) </strong>and <strong>Silent Night Deadly Night (1984)</strong>.",

        "Time to summarize my thoughts about this watchlist as a whole.  For some reason, I enjoyed this much more than previous watchlists.  I think what really helped was specifying the order of the movies upfront.  In some previous watchlists, I just threw out 30-40 movies into a list and my goal was just to pick from that list until I’d watched all of them.  What that does is causes me to pick the most interesting ones first, leaving the ones I don’t <em>really</em> want to watch for the end, so maybe that’s what tired me out in those cases.  Anyway, I think this format is the way to go for me!",
        "Ratings",
        "I’m into numbers and stats and I like to try to quantify my experience with ratings.  I find that I’m very moderate when it comes to rating something.  It’s very hard for a first watch of a movie to land in the 9+ territory and a movie has to be pretty bad to me to land below 4.  So I end up rating a lot of things between 5-7.  Maybe that’s just horror, though.  I watched <strong>Spirited Away (2001)</strong> recently and that would be like a 9 for me.  As much as I love horror, most of the movies I watch are pretty mediocre.  It’s still comfort food for me so I don’t mind, but it explains why my ratings were generally so lukewarm.",
        "I don’t know of a good way to format the ratings in blog format and the ratings are on each post, so let me just rank my top 10 and bottom 10 of this list:",
        "<strong>Top 10</strong>",
        "<li><strong>A Dark Song </strong>– Something about the atmosphere and tension just did it for me</li><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – Not really traditional horror, but the drama and portrayal of the main character’s issues were very intense</li><li><strong>Ringu</strong> – Of course this is a classic by now, and having already seen the American remake before, some of the impact was taken out of it, but still very good</li><li><strong>Idle Hands</strong> – I did not expect to enjoy this one much and was pleasantly surprised.  It’s fun and takes me back to those simpler late 90s days</li><li><strong>Phenomena</strong> – The vibe, the music, the settings all stuck with me</li><li><strong>Devil</strong> – Though some of the acting was a little.. eh, the premise and execution were pretty engaging</li><li><strong>Species</strong> – Again, I did not expect much from this but somehow the 90s cheese and CGI still worked</li><li><strong>House of Wax</strong> – One of the best Vincent Price movies that I’ve seen with an actually creepy killer </li><li><strong>Night Key</strong> – Old school horror comedy that doesn’t try so hard to be funny, but relies mostly on the fun relationship between the two main characters</li><li><strong>The Masque of the Red Death</strong> – Vincent Price being evil, rich people being stupid and everyone getting punished for it.. surprisingly fun.</li>",
        "So if you are taking notes at home, that’s two movies from Week 2 (90s), two from Week 3 (Japanese), one from Week 5 (Universal), two from Week 6 (Supernatural), one from Week 8 (Italian) and two from Week 9 (Vincent Price).  Sorry weeks 1, 3, 4 and 7.. but I have a feeling we’ll hear from some of you in this next list….",
        "<strong>Bottom 10 (worst first)</strong>",
        "<li><strong>Devil’s Due </strong>– Cheap found footage, bad acting, boring characters, unoriginal plot.. there’s not much for me to like here</li><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – Man I know Al Adamson movies are low budget but.. yeesh.  This one is just too bad and the Dracula character is laughable</li><li><strong>The Apparition </strong>– Honestly, I can barely remember this movie at all, so that should say something</li><li><strong>Brain of Blood</strong> – Fun movies can overcome low budget cheapness.. but this was not one of those</li><li><strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – God, that butler character was just so unfunny.  I mean, the whole movie was unfunny but that guy..</li><li><strong>Horror of the Blood Monsters</strong> – This one is so bizarre.  I found later that its just pieced together footage in attempt to make a cohesive movie.  Nice try..</li><li><strong>Exeter</strong> – I’m not sure how to describe it, but this is just the kind of uninteresting post-2000s horror that I don’t really enjoy</li><li><strong>Blood of Ghastly Horror</strong> – Man, I know I’m bashing on Al Adamson too much but I just can’t call his movies “good”.  This was a bit more like a “real” movie but still..</li><li><strong>Splatter University</strong> – Even among cheaply made 80s slashers, this one was a little underwhelming</li><li><strong>The Rite</strong> – Too slow and the exorcism thing feels overdone to me</li>",

Comparing each of those, Sci-Fi over Supernatural, 90s over 80s Slashers, Japanese over Italian and Vincent Price over Al Adamson.  Since there are only 9 weeks, here are the overall rankings, starting with my favorite.  To preface, “official average” means the average rating of the five “official” movies for the week and “overall average” means the average rating of all movies that week combined, official and bonus.",
        "<li><strong>90s</strong> – I never would have guessed going into it.. but many of the movies I picked for the 90s week were “fun” horror and I just enjoyed it overall.  Official average: <strong>7.10</strong>, overall average: <strong>6.63</strong>, movies watched: <strong>8</strong></li><li><strong>Japanese</strong> – The strength of Ringu and Kotoko made the week pretty solid, despite the other two Ringu movies being pretty.. meh.  Official average: <strong>6.80</strong>, overall average: <strong>6.92</strong>, movies watched: <strong>6</strong></li><li><strong>Italian</strong> – There weren’t any big standout movies, but they were all just solidly entertaining and well-made.  Official average: <strong>6.80</strong>, overall average: <strong>6.43</strong>, movies watched: <strong>7</strong></li><li><strong>Universal</strong> – One reason I enjoyed this week because the movies were short, so they never dragged and I was easily able to squeeze in a lot of movies that week.  Official average: <strong>6.60</strong>, overall average: <strong>5.95</strong>, movies watched: <strong>11</strong></li><li><strong>Sci-Fi</strong> – A mix of old school 50s sci-fi and effects-heavy 80s sc-fi, it was a fun week, though not the highest quality films.  Official average: <strong>6.50</strong>, overall average: <strong>6.25</strong>, movies watched: <strong>8</strong></li><li><strong>Vincent Price</strong> – Like the Italian week, most movies were at least solid, although they felt a little repetitive by the end.  Official average: <strong>6.40</strong>, overall average: <strong>6.21</strong>, movies watched: <strong>7</strong></li><li><strong>Supernatural</strong> – I actually dreaded this week a lot and I was quite surprised by A Dark Song and Devil, which covered for some more mediocre movies during the week.  Official average: <strong>6.20</strong>, overall average: <strong>5.39</strong>, movies watched: <strong>9</strong></li><li><strong>80s Slashers</strong> – I would have thought this would be near the top of my favorite weeks, but let’s face it.. 80s slashers are generally not great movies and the ones that are, I’ve probably already seen.  Official average: <strong>5.50</strong>, overall average: <strong>5.81</strong>, movies watched: <strong>8</strong></li><li><strong>Al Adamson</strong> – By a pretty large margin, this week was the worst in my ratings.  He worked with low budgets to try to turn profits and the creativity is there, but the end results are kind of a mess.  Official average: <strong>4.10</strong>, overall average: <strong>4.58</strong>, movies watched: <strong>6</strong></li>",
        "In chronological order, the rankings are: #5, #1, #2, #9, #4, #7, #8, #3, #6.  What that mostly means was that the first half was more enjoyable for me.  Some of that may have to do with me getting “stricter” on movies after some time, or just getting a little jaded.",

I look forward to going back and looking at this years down the road.  With October ending soon, this watchlist is over, but I’m already thinking about making other watchlists that are not genre-specific like this one.  I have some action-adventure movies in my backlog and a few drama.  Related to horror I have a <em>lot</em> of Godzilla and Gamera movies unwatched and I don’t know if I want to wait until next Halloween to start on those.  So maybe I will have some weekly watchlists sometimes, maybe just 3-4 movies per week.  I only go this hard for Halloween season.  “Anyway”, we’ll see where it goes next!",

          "So, first thing’s first.. I already have 39 movies down, which means 14 “bonus” movies.  I didn’t really expect to tackle that many, but most of that is due to how short the Universal horror movies were in the 30s and 40s, so I got 6 bonus movies out of that list.  At this rate, I should end up watching 60-70 movies when it’s all over.  It’s nice catching up on the backlog.",
          "Surprisingly, I’ve probably had the most fun with Week 2 (90s horror).  The 90s is typically considered the worst decade for horror, but I guess the mid-late 90s nostalgia hits me a bit more.  Week 4 (Al Adamson movies) was the weakest, but I don’t think that’s too surprising.  I appreciate his commitment to churning movies out, but they were obviously about piggybacking off of other popular movies to try to make a profit.  But hey, that doesn’t mean they can’t have some entertainment value.",
          "I really enjoy the format of this watchlist, specifically having weekly themes.  I’ve considered having something more like a “daily” theme.  For example, day 1 – Sci Fi, day 2 – 90s, day 3 – Japenese horror, etc.  But it’s really fun immersing yourself in one style or theme for a whole week.  That makes the weeks really distinct, so when you (Future Me) look back on this watchlist, you’ll have very clear memories of various weeks and it won’t all blur together.  You’re welcome.",
          "I’m looking forward to the next few weeks and, even more than that, I’m looking forward to the next time I make a watchlist.  Maybe I’ll feel differently once this watchlist is over and maybe I’ll be ready for a break for a while, but right now, I’m still thinking about other themes I could make for other watchlists.  I guess I don’t have to do horror-only watchlists.. I could have a broader genre watchlist in a couple months but of course Halloween time watchlists will always be my favorite",

The lowlights were <strong>The Lazarus Effect (2015)</strong>, <strong>Unfriended (2014)</strong>.  Although the watchlist originally started as a way to track all the “Halloween”-like movies I wanted to make sure to re-watch (the Halloween series, Trick r Treat, that kind of stuff), it turned into a generic horror watchlist.

Not much to say about that, although I dove into some Italian/Giallo type movies.  <strong>Don’t Torture a Duckling (1972)</strong> was pretty good and it taught me not to torture a duckling.  <strong>Deep Red (1975)</strong> of course was also good.  I also checked out some 70s Japanese horror, but my memory on those is a bit fuzzy (a blog would have helped, huh?)  Aside from that, one notable movie was <strong>Candyman (1992)</strong>, which was all right, but I was expecting something a little different, not so psychological.  With a name like Candyman, I expected something like a candy factory owner who invites kids to see the factory with Golden Tickets, but this wasn’t it.  Maybe someday we’ll get that movie.",

The difference this time was that it could be any genre of movie, not just horror.  Of course, I generally preferred the good movies.

I’m starting August 30th, giving me 9 full weeks until Halloween.  In those 9 weeks, I’ve mapped out a theme for each week, with five movies fitting that week’s theme.  If I’m feeling extra ambitious, I’ve got 2-3 extra movies in each week.. so the goal is to at least watch 45 new movies from my collection (mostly Arrow Video, Scream Factory and Severin).

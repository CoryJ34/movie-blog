      "It’s been just over six months (Aug 31 – Mar 7) since I started this experiment and it’s been surprisingly enjoyable for a number of reasons.. it’s fun coming up with watchlists, actually watching the movies, jotting down some thoughts and going back and re-reading those thoughts weeks and months later.  Another guilty pleasure of mine is the stats.. so it seems like a good time to look back at the first six months of this blog and take a look at some stats, some highlights, some lowlights and just other observations.  Time to nerd out!",
      "<strong>My Ratings</strong>",
      "First, I’ve been thinking about my rating system and what the numbers mean, so I’ll go ahead and try to “formalize” it a little (zzzzz..):",
      "<strong>10</strong> – These are reserved for my very favorite movies.  There’s no such thing as a “perfect” movie but this is as close as it gets for me.  These movies are enjoyable all the way through and are those “stranded on an island” movies.. the movies I’d take if I were to be left on some island for years with nothing else to watch but those.  What puts them above something like a 9-9.5 is that these have some personal meaning or something I associate my identity with in addition to just being a good movie.  I don’t give something a 10 right away either.. it takes time for me to know if a movie is in that category, so most of my 10s are older movies",
      "<strong>9-9.5</strong> – Amazing movies, but don’t quite have that personal connection for me.  But otherwise, these are also pretty much a joy to watch from beginning to end.  I’ll re-watch these movies every year or two",
      "<strong>8-8.5</strong> – Really good movies that I plan on watching again.  They have some minor flaws, maybe they drag at some point or they take a wrong turn somewhere, but they are still undeniably good",
      "<strong>7-7.5</strong> – Good but only engaging in bursts.  For me, it’s a movie where I can say “oh I liked that part and that part” or “the cast was good and it was pretty well-made, but I lost interest a little here and there”",
      "<strong>6-6.5</strong> – Above average.  Not really bad, has some merit or entertainment value, but just not really consistently entertaining enough to hold my attention",
      "<strong>5-5.5</strong> – Average.  I didn’t actively dislike it but I would have been fine not having watched it at all.  It’s basically a “competent” movie but that’s about it",
      "<strong>4-4.5</strong> – Below average.  Usually a combination of low quality and bad writing/acting.  Some of these have heart and effort in them but the filmmaking is just not good",
      "<strong>3-3.5</strong> – Bad.  I don’t often go this low unless the movie is just really poorly made, really uninteresting or really dumb",
      "<strong>2-2.5</strong> – Really bad.  These are movies I’m kind of annoyed I even took the time to watch.  I almost never give anything this low of a rating because most movies have some respectable or redeemable aspects to them",
      "<strong>1-1.5</strong> – Unwatchable.  There are probably only a handful of movies I’ve seen in my life that I would go this low on.  They are basically one step above home movies.",
      "<strong>0-0.5</strong> – Doesn’t apply.. I would give every movie at least a 1 for the effort, even if the effort was terrible or misguided",
      "<strong>Watchlists</strong>",
      "For these six-ish months, I made five watchlists:",
      "<li><strong>Halloween 2020</strong> – [<strong>70</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.01</strong>] – The one that started it all.  It was planned as 45 movies with the option to toss in some bonus movies and I tossed in quite a few.  I enjoyed immersing myself in one genre/style of movie at a time for a whole week</li><li><strong>Nov/Dec 2020 </strong>– [<strong>21</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.10</strong>] – This was like a miniature version of the Halloween watchlist, but not so very horror-focused.  I sprinkled in some westerns, action, drama.. but still ended with some Christmas-themed horror</li><li><strong>Gamera</strong> – [<strong>12</strong> movies, avg: <strong>5.58</strong>] – I decided to bite the bullet and just watch ALL of the Gamera movies since I had the full Arrow set.  It was a mix of ok movies with some pretty bad ones</li><li><strong>Randomizer</strong> – [<strong>10</strong> movies, avg: <strong>5.75</strong>] – Wasn’t sure where to go and didn’t have a good idea for a more involved watchlist, so I just made a random generator to pick 10 movies among my unwatched list.  It was an ok experiment but it lacked cohesion  without any themes or categories to follow</li><li><strong>March Madness</strong> – [<strong>32</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.31</strong>] – Another experiment but this one worked out much better.  It’s fun to pit movies against each other and see which ones make it surprisingly far into the bracket</li>",
      "For the total numbers, that’s <strong>145</strong> movies with an average rating of <strong>6.04</strong>.  The distribution looks like this (nerd alert):",

      "It’s a bit of a bell curve but it really drops off from the 7.5 range to the 8+ range.  A good chunk of the movies are in that 6-7 range.  My theory on why the top of the curve skews towards that range (instead of at 5, the mid-point of the scale) is that these are movies I’ve bought.  While I do blind buy a lot of cheesy/bad movies just for the sake of collecting, I’m still buying movies, mostly horror, that are genres/styles that I already like.  So it’s not like I’m watching Hallmark Christmas movies in these watchlists.",
      "<strong>Top 10</strong>",
      "Out of 145 movies, here are the 10 that really stood out for me:",
      "<li><strong>A Dark Song</strong> – A slow-burn but just really high quality.  The “feel” (or atmosphere or vibe or whatever word I’m using that day) is important to me and this one’s vibe is great</li><li><strong>The Editor</strong> – I <em>just</em> watched this yesterday so maybe my opinion hasn’t had time to fully form, but this was just fun and entertaining with a lot of Easter eggs for horror fans</li><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – Another more recent watch.  Hard to explain why this one stuck with me, but I guess the realism is one of the main reasons</li><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – More drama than horror, but it’s still intense.  It’s hard to watch someone in such a bad mental state, but I feel like it was really well-portrayed</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – More Fessenden.  I mentioned it earlier but it’s an interesting take on destructive habits/relationships</li><li><strong>Hearts in Atlantis</strong> – Great acting and a story that I kind of “get” as a Stephen King/Dark Tower fan</li><li><strong>Ringu</strong> – Not as impactful as it could be since I already knew the major points from the American remake, but still well-made</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – If there was a bit more explanation and “glue” in the movie, it would have been one of the top two or three.  It’s basically an American giallo that gets pretty extreme</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – The more I think about this one, the more fondly I remember it.  Some campy moments, of course, but some pretty hilarious stuff too.</li><li><strong>Phenomena </strong>– It’s got the atmosphere, the music, the actors and a monkey</li>",
      "Honorable mentions that almost made the list: <strong>Idle Hands</strong>, <strong>The Alamo</strong>, <strong>Devil, The Last Winter</strong>",
      "<strong>Bottom 10</strong>",
      "Well, it’s time to look at the worst, starting with the absolute worst:",
      "<li><strong>Devil’s Due</strong> – Cheap found footage, bad acting, unoriginal premise… just nothing appealing to me</li><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – If I hadn’t seen any other Gamera movie, maybe this would be ok as it’s more or less a clip show of older Gamera movies</li><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – Just too low budget, low quality, bad acting and kind of incoherent</li><li><strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – Only a couple minutes of horror and wasp woman near the end.. otherwise it’s a really dull movie</li><li><strong>The Apparition</strong> – I’m not a fan of modern day haunting/supernatural movies and this one is exactly why.  Didn’t like the characters, the acting, the premise</li><li><strong>Brain of Blood</strong> – Really forgettable, but I do remember it was low quality and not very interesting..</li><li><strong>Horror of the Blood Monsters</strong> – Pretty incoherent, just a lot of stuff glued together</li><li><strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – The poor attempt at comedy here was really tough to watch</li><li><strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation</strong> – If it was actually Christmas-themed, I would have been all right with the movie.. mostly..</li><li><strong>The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</strong> – Gross and unfunny, but I could see kids liking it.  Maybe weird kids</li>",
      "Dishonorable mentions: <strong>Carnival Magic, Gamers vs Zigra, Mirrors 2, </strong>and <strong>The Wizard of Gore</strong>",
      "<strong>Labels</strong>",
      "I love to collect movies from various labels.. Scream Factory, Arrow, etc.  They put out a lot of weird interesting obscure stuff, mostly in the horror genre.  So I got curious to see the numbers from these 145 movies:",
      "<li><strong>Arrow</strong> – [<strong>41</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.20</strong>] – A <em>ton</em> of Arrow movies.  Twelve of those were just the Gamera set, but I watched some from other collections (Tsukamoto, HG Lewis).  I also got some 80s slashers and gialli out of it</li><li><strong>Scream Factory (Other)</strong> – [<strong>31</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.40</strong>] – I differentiated the Scream Factory category between the Collector’s Editions and the other releases (individuals, box sets, steelbooks).  A lot of these came from the Universal Horror sets as well as the Larry Fessenden set</li><li><strong>Scream Factory (Collector’s Edition)</strong> – [<strong>14</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.18</strong>] – Not as many as I expected there to be.  I got a lot of the 90s and early 2000s movies from here, as well as a few Hammer</li><li><strong>Severin </strong>– [<strong>11</strong> movies, avg: <strong>4.91</strong>] – Most of these were the Al Adamson set, which is reflected in the low average rating.  Sorry, guy</li><li><strong>Vinegar Syndrome</strong> – [<strong>9</strong> movies, avg: <strong>5.94</strong>] – The Forgotten Gialli set was good, the other individual watches were not so good</li>",
      "Other than that, there weren’t much in other categories.. 4 from <strong>Synapse</strong>, 3 from <strong>Blue Undergorund</strong>, 3 from <strong>Kino Lorber</strong>, 2 from <strong>MVD Rewind</strong>, and 1 <strong>Criterion</strong>.",
      "",
      "Well, there you have it.  I might think of more notes I want to put down in this post later, but this is it for now!  It will give me a lot to re-read later.  I’m looking forward to watching more movies this way and, since I’m constantly buying new ones, I’ll always have more options to draw from.  Time to start working on the next watchlist..",

      "Ahhh… intermission.",
      "We’re at the halfway point (or just past it) after finishing week 5 and having 4 weeks to go, so I thought I’d give some thoughts.  Curious to see how these thoughts will compare to how I feel when the whole watchlist is over at the end of October.",
      "So, first thing’s first.. I already have 39 movies down, which means 14 “bonus” movies.  I didn’t really expect to tackle that many, but most of that is due to how short the Universal horror movies were in the 30s and 40s, so I got 6 bonus movies out of that list.  At this rate, I should end up watching 60-70 movies when it’s all over.  It’s nice catching up on the backlog.",
      "Surprisingly, I’ve probably had the most fun with Week 2 (90s horror).  The 90s is typically considered the worst decade for horror, but I guess the mid-late 90s nostalgia hits me a bit more.  Week 4 (Al Adamson movies) was the weakest, but I don’t think that’s too surprising.  I appreciate his commitment to churning movies out, but they were obviously about piggybacking off of other popular movies to try to make a profit.  But hey, that doesn’t mean they can’t have some entertainment value.",
      "I really enjoy the format of this watchlist, specifically having weekly themes.  I’ve considered having something more like a “daily” theme.  For example, day 1 – Sci Fi, day 2 – 90s, day 3 – Japenese horror, etc.  But it’s really fun immersing yourself in one style or theme for a whole week.  That makes the weeks really distinct, so when you (Future Me) look back on this watchlist, you’ll have very clear memories of various weeks and it won’t all blur together.  You’re welcome.",
      "I’m looking forward to the next few weeks and, even more than that, I’m looking forward to the next time I make a watchlist.  Maybe I’ll feel differently once this watchlist is over and maybe I’ll be ready for a break for a while, but right now, I’m still thinking about other themes I could make for other watchlists.  I guess I don’t have to do horror-only watchlists.. I could have a broader genre watchlist in a couple months but of course Halloween time watchlists will always be my favorite",

      "Oh, hello.  What is this thing?  The whole idea is to make a kind of journal of my first-time viewings of movies, particularly during the Halloween “season” (“season” in quotes because my Halloween season starts in late August..)  I hope to look back on these posts some day and think “oooh yeah, I remember that”.  I guess that’s what journals are all about.. so if you’re reading this Future Me, enjoy this little trip down memory lane.",
      "Ok, just to jog your memory, Future Me, this is the start of <em>my</em> 2020 Halloween season (remember 2020?  wild year).  Since 2018, I’ve made watch lists, mostly around Halloween, as a motivation to watch a lot of the horror (and horror-ish) movies I’ve bought but still haven’t watched.  ",
      "<h2>Halloween 2018</h2>",
      "In 2018, I watched ~30 new movies.  The highlights were <strong>Maniac (2012),</strong> <strong>Madhouse (1981)</strong> and I had a soft spot for <strong>It’s Alive (1974)</strong>.  The lowlights were <strong>The Lazarus Effect (2015)</strong>, <strong>Unfriended (2014)</strong>.  Although the watchlist originally started as a way to track all the “Halloween”-like movies I wanted to make sure to re-watch (the Halloween series, Trick r Treat, that kind of stuff), it turned into a generic horror watchlist.  It turned out to be a fun exercise in watching a variety of films across different eras and sub-genres, so I decided to keep it up each year",
      "<h2>Bonus watchlist: February 2019</h2>",
      "I had a lot of time on my hands around this time, so what better way to spend some of it than with another watchlist (Halloween in February).  Not much to say about that, although I dove into some Italian/Giallo type movies.  <strong>Don’t Torture a Duckling (1972)</strong> was pretty good and it taught me not to torture a duckling.  <strong>Deep Red (1975)</strong> of course was also good.  I also checked out some 70s Japanese horror, but my memory on those is a bit fuzzy (a blog would have helped, huh?)  Aside from that, one notable movie was <strong>Candyman (1992)</strong>, which was all right, but I was expecting something a little different, not so psychological.  With a name like Candyman, I expected something like a candy factory owner who invites kids to see the factory with Golden Tickets, but this wasn’t it.  Maybe someday we’ll get that movie.",
      "<h2>Bonus watchlist: March 2019 Weekly</h2>",
      "I tried something new in March 2019.  My idea was to pick five movies per week and watch them in order, from lowest rated on Letterboxd to highest.  Basically, I’d pick (based on user ratings) a really bad movie, a kind of bad movie, a mediocre movie, an all right movie and a good movie.  The difference this time was that it could be any genre of movie, not just horror.  Of course, I generally preferred the good movies.  My favorites were <strong>Paris, Texas (1984)</strong> and <strong>The Wicker Man (1973)</strong>.. not the Nic Cage one, which, at the time of writing this, I haven’t seen.  Maybe you’ve seen it, Future Me.. maybe you’re looking back at sweet, naive Past You with a longing for a time when you hadn’t seen that movie.",
      "<h2>Halloween 2019</h2>",
      "For Halloween 2019, I watched 34 movies.  None of these movies were particularly memorable to me.  What I do remember was:",
      "<li><strong>Death Valley (1982)</strong> with Ralphie from A Christmas Story</li><li><strong>Chillerama (2011)</strong> which was some weird shit (and not really a movie I’d recommend to people..)</li><li><strong>Braindead (1992)</strong> (or Dead Alive) was a little disappointing for me after hearing so much about it. Maybe I’m just not into the crazier comedy horror stuff</li>",
      "My least favorite of each watchlist were probably the newer ones (post-2010).  Part of that is because I used the watchlist as an excuse to watch a few newer blu-rays I received in the mail through the Horror Pack subscription.. they were disappointing but, hey.. worth a shot.",
      "<h2>Halloween 2020</h2>",
      "Finally, time to talk about 2020.  Wasn’t that the point of this post?  Well anyway, this year, I was pretty eager to get to it.  Start October 1st?  Nah.  Start September 15th?  Nope.  I’m starting August 30th, giving me 9 full weeks until Halloween.  In those 9 weeks, I’ve mapped out a theme for each week, with five movies fitting that week’s theme.  If I’m feeling extra ambitious, I’ve got 2-3 extra movies in each week.. so the goal is to at least watch 45 new movies from my collection (mostly Arrow Video, Scream Factory and Severin).  Who knows, maybe I’ll end up watching 60 new movies by the end of October.. and then I’ll go back into my sad little post-Halloween shell and just wait patiently for 10 months.  So anyway, Future Me, enjoy this blog!",

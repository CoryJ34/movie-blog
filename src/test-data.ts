      "On one hand, this is the “least” heavy drama of this category because it has some humor here and there, but on the other hand, it feels the heaviest.  I guess because it’s a more relatable situation, time and place for someone like me.  Every other drama I watched this time around was some period piece, mostly outside the US, so while I can appreciate the drama, it’s hard to put myself in those shoes.  Marriage Story is purely a personal drama about marriage, divorce, parenthood and custody.  It feels the most “real life” to me.. just normal people in normal circumstances.  The movie is smaller in scope and focuses entirely on the two main characters and it seems like watching a play (or maybe I just felt that due to them being a play director/actress).  It makes me think of <strong>Whiplash (2014)</strong> in a way.. the kind of movie that I’d rewatch just to enjoy the performances and the natural progression of the story.  Knowing <em>what</em> happens in these movies is fine to focus on the first watch, but after that, just rewatching for <em>how</em> it happens makes it worth revisiting.  Summing it all up.. really great acting, really good realistic portrayal of “normal” life, really good writing.",

      "I remember hearing a lot of hype about this one.. mainly that a lot of people thought this should have been the 2018 Best Picture winner.  Although I’ve owned the movie for maybe a year, I just never felt in the “mood” for this style of movie, despite it having that hype.  It can be hard to sit down for 2 hr 15 min black and white foreign-language film.. I know, I know.. I’m weak.  It’s not to say I don’t like those, it’s just an investment.  Finally sitting down to watch it, I did find it very engaging and a little “hypnotic” in how slow the camera moved.  The movie is kind of one of those “slice of life” type movies where it’s really just about a time/place and someone’s experience in that time.. where the story and actions are less important.  The main character is a maid for a family in Mexico in the early 1970s.  Once I got used to the pace and the idea that not a lot “happens” (in terms of specific actions), I started to enjoy it better.  Visually, the movie is great… but.. I can’t help but wonder what it would look like in color.  Yeah, I’m one of those people.  Not anti-black&amp;white movies.. I just imagine this era would have had some really vibrant and distinct colors.  And some long-lasting shots must have taken forever to get right.  Also, this is another movie where the sound is really natural, no soundtrack over the top to try to heighten the drama.  Overall, I struggled a little with the pacing and got a little tired of seeing this family.. but I definitely can recognize how impressive the filmmaking is and I did enjoy it in the end.",

    "content": [
      "So far the theme of this week is people’s cruelty to other people.. very uplifting.  This one hits a little harder given that it’s based on actual events.  The way the movie plays out is very straight.. not a lot of overdramatics or music to evoke emotion, just the events as they happen, so that makes it feel a little more brutal.  The premise is based on a real life hotel manager in Rwanda who gets caught up in the genocide and risks his own life (and money) to protect others.  It’s a little like <strong>Schindler’s List (1993)</strong> in some ways, but here, the main character is caught up in the chaos and confusion himself.  One thing I like in movies is when they capture an “as it happens” type thing.  For example (completely different movie..), <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968)</strong> has that.  Maybe my favorite thing about that movie is that the viewer is watching everything go down as the characters are.. learning about things from the radio, from stories from other people, etc.   This movie has that to a degree and that makes it more interesting to me.  Overall, it’s a good movie, but I don’t know if it’s one that I’d go back and watch repeatedly just because of it’s depressing tone.",

      "Not as dark in tone as <strong>The Elephant Man</strong>, but it goes to some darker places.  I think the movie was pretty well-done, especially the acting.  I can’t say I’m too familiar with Whoopi Goldberg’s film roles (outside of the <strong>Sister Act</strong> movies) and less familiar with Oprah’s roles, but they were both really good in this.  Danny Glover was a bastard man.  Anyway, the movie’s story is not so well-structured for me.  It really just follows one character as she grows up in a household where she faces and witnesses racism, sexism, abuse, but also bonds with other girls.  From what I’ve read about the responses to this movie, a lot of people feel like it was Steven Spielberg Oscar-baiting hard.  I can kind of get that.. it’s a delicate subject matter and should evoke some strong emotions and that’s usually what gets those Oscar votes.  The difference is when it feels like the goal is to get Oscar attention vs to tell the story.  It’s hard to say if he is veering towards the former here, but there is a little bit of a “sugary” feel to the storytelling, style, music.. but anyway, it’s still good, but I wonder if the story could have been told in a “stronger” way to really emphasize the bad so that the good stands out more.  But I’m no filmmaker, just a filmwatcher.",

      "Oo all them crazy elephant bones.  Anyway, this is the start of the “Heavy Drama” week and this one is already pretty depressing.  Although, it does have its moments of hope and beauty and I guess that’s supposed to be the takeaway.  The Elephant Man was a real person, John Merrick, who had some pretty severe deformities.  I don’t know much else about his life, so I have no idea if much of this movie is based on truth.  Either way, it’s a pretty brutal look at how society treats those who are different.  From the start, you already sympathize with John, so seeing him treated like a freak already gets you upset.  It’s got a good cast and is directed by David Lynch, although this is probably the most “straight” David Lynch thing I’ve seen.  It has some surreal moments but otherwise it’s a pretty straightforward drama.  It’s a little too stark sometimes which kind of dimmed my enjoyment, but it’s still a solid movie.",

      "I’m a broken record, but I feel like I know this movie because of the references in other media, mainly The Simpsons.  Milhouse jumping from the tunnel, Homer escaping the police truck.  The actual movie is interesting, though.  The part that appeals to me the most is the “survival” aspect.  He has nothing but has to find the means to survive and escape, so as a viewer, you get that tension.  Of course, the movie probably wouldn’t be as well-remembered if it didn’t have Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as the leads.  It’s really a simple premise: a man is convicted of murdering his wife, but he didn’t do it.. he is imprisoned but gets an opportunity to escape the prison bus so he does and then works to prove his innocence, but while being pursued by a federal marshal.  Gets right to the point, I like it.  My main complaint is the length of the movie… 2 hr 10 min is quite a bit for this premise.  While it’s good, I think some things could have been condensed or cut to make it just a little tighter and move along better.  But I’m no movie critic, what do I know.  Still a good movie despite my complaint.",

All were good, but I think the older 60s style of action movie just wasn’t the right pace for me.  Dirty Harry had the archetypal renegade cop, The Fugitive had the immersion and Lethal Weapon had the characters.</li><li>This was a step up for me from the Serious Sci-Fi category.  Maybe it’s because action movies aren’t meant to be too deep, but just appeal to your instincts.  Sci-fi is supposed to make you think and ask some philosophical questions.. so when the sci-fi movies miss that, they don’t have a lot left.  These action movies perfectly fit the bill for what I expected</li>",

I have seen <strong>National Lampoon’s Loaded Weapon 1 (1993)</strong> several times and I’ve seen It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s “Lethal Weapon” movies… so I had a good idea of what this was all about.  Reliable, straight-edge cop is paired up with an unstable, unorthodox cop and they work together to take down some criminal organization.  This is one I always associated with <strong>Die Hard (1988)</strong> because of the time it was released as well as having several sequels through the late 80s and 90s.  They even both have Christmas backdrops.  So going into it with everything I already knew, there wasn’t too much in the way of surprises, but it’s an enjoyable movie, mainly because of the relationship between the two main characters.  I guess this is THE buddy cop movie, just like <strong>Dirty Harry</strong> is THE loose cannon movie.  Good acting by the leads, but the overall story feels a little “typical”.. maybe it’s just been emulated too much since, so it doesn’t stand out anymore.  But I think a Lethal Weapon + Die Hard Christmas double feature would be someday..",

      "The only thing I really knew about this movie was that it had Steve McQueen and one of those most famous car chase scenes.  It’s a little light on the action compared to what I expected, but I actually like that slower burn in this movie.  The premise is just that the main character has the job of defending someone who is to be a witness, but things go a little south.. Pretty simple premise, but it has a little bit of that <strong>Godfather (1972)</strong> element of someone trying to get to someone at a hospital.  And of course the car chase scene is pretty good.. I normally don’t really care about car chases, but something about the way this was shot with some shots from inside the car.. as well as being on the hilly San Francisco streets.. it’s pretty fun to watch.  In the end, it’s a decent action movie with a nice tone and a good cast (Mr Roper!)",

      "The first James Bond movie is about as “classic action” as it gets.  It’s probably a little wild that I haven’t seen the first James Bond movie but.. I’ll go a step further: I’ve never seen any James Bond movie.  Sure, I’ve seen clips, I’ve seen parodies and I played GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64… but, not being a big action guy, I never sat down to watch one.  That might be heresy but I’ve righted the wrong now.  After watching this one, I can understand why it became as popular as it did.  I really doubt there was anything quite like it in the early 60s and I can tell that it influenced action movies for decades after.  Watching it now, it’s still a fun adventure and, yeah, a bit dated culturally, but taking it for what it is, it’s fun.  I wasn’t expecting this movie to be so..tropical.  In my mind, I imagined James Bond always in urban areas, casinos, big formal gatherings, etc.  But it makes for a good adventure and they do end up in the bad guy’s evil base eventually.  I would watch more of the classic James Bond movies at some point, assuming they kind of build on this template.",

It also has my favorite style of the bunch, although the music is sometimes a little strange.  It feels like I’m listening to SNES boss music or something.  But it all fits together pretty well to make a unique setting, very 80s artsy/hipster.  While I may not really “get” the point of it all, the experience is interesting.  It’s hard to even explain what the plot is.. there are a couple performance art/fashion model type girls and a lot of encounters with drugs, abuse and a weird photo shoot crew… and then also some guy who studies UFOs is mixed in there.  Pretty weird, but it’s a cool time capsule of a kind of 80s subculture and it’s a pretty fun experience.",

And it’s more fantasy than sci-fi.  Anyway, this is a movie I knew nothing about when I first saw it at the movie store, but I was pretty intrigued by the style, just looking at it.  The animation is cool and the visual style is interesting, but it’s also kind of inconsistent.  The music is definitely a product of its time.. funky, psychedelic.  The premise is nothing fancy.. magic vs technology and brother vs brother, but it’s the style that makes it unique.  While it gets points for being visually interesting, the rest of it was just kind of underwhelming.  The voice acting sometimes seemed really awkward or just didn’t seem to match the style and tone of the movie.  Like the main wizard character sounded a little like some NYC wise guy.. I dunno.

That part was interesting.. but as far as sci-fi goes, there is very little in that regard, besides the “time travel” aspect and the planetary dome where “future Billy” lives.  The rest of the movie is more like a light historical war drama with some “older Billy” life moments peppered in.  I have to say, I don’t really “get” it.  It’s an interesting idea, sure, but I guess I’m not sure what it’s trying to say.  The movie just felt like it was dragging to me.  It felt a lot longer than it was.

      "At first, I was really confused by this prequel to <strong>Cool Runnings (1994)</strong>.  Yeah, kidding.  I bought this solely because it was Arrow and it looked promising.. 70s sci-fi with Bruce Dern.  It ends up being a kind of one-man show in a space base/station, which reminds me of <strong>Moon (2009)</strong> with Sam Rockwell.  However, Moon seemed to deal a lot more with philosophical topics and the question of identity.. Silent Running feels a bit more like a hippie nature movie but in space.  I don’t know if I really “got” the point other than this guy really wanted to preserve the forest on the space station and was going a little crazy.  The aesthetic is good.. about what I would expect from this era of sci-fi.. and the setup got me ready for something good.. but in the end, it didn’t quite live up to all that.  Partly because, like I said, I wasn’t sure what the point of it all was.  Second, although he does a decent job most of the time, sometimes the acting is a little awkward.. I don’t know if part of that is supposed to be how the character is or if they could have tried a few more takes to get something a little better.

      "Starting the sci-fi group with a movie I was mostly familiar with due to the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror segment that parodied it.  I like the “last person alive” type of premise (ok, he isn’t the last person alive) since I think everyone wonders what they’d do if they had the whole world to themselves but were alone.  I guess I’d still collect movies, but may I’d move into an old video rental store.  After a while, a person would go crazy.  In a movie like this, I would have liked to see more of the “as it happened” aspect, instead of just dropping in when this guy has already been living this way for a while.  I think the physical and mental survival is the more interesting part of a post-apocalyptic setting.  I’ve seen <strong>The Last Man on Earth (1964)</strong> so I was aware of the premise from the original novel, but I wasn’t really aware that this movie was based on the same source.

I’m always skeptical of sequels that come out way after the original(s).. it’s hard to capture something so many years later.

In the end, I found this to be a fun tribute to the originals with a lot of small references and callbacks.  For someone not familiar with originals, it may be hard to “get” and I wouldn’t blame someone for considering this a “meh” movie.  It does have some problems that even a Bill and Ted fanboy can’t get over.. the ending is a bit.. much for me.  And I really wish the daughter characters had a bit more of their own unique personalities.  It seemed like a Bill and Ted impersonation and it was awkward for me.

      "The adventures continue.  I like the idea of big monsters like Godzilla and King Kong, but there aren’t a lot of big monster movies that I actually like.  The original <strong>Godzilla (1954)</strong> and <strong>King Kong (1933)</strong> are good for their times, but watching them today, I mainly only appreciate their significance.  The 2014 and 2019 Godzilla movies (I’ve only seen the first 1/3 or so of the 2019 one..) don’t really do it for me.  I don’t know why they have to fill a giant monster movie with so much uninteresting human drama with really uninteresting characters.  I enjoyed <strong>Shin Godzilla (2016)</strong> much more due to the fact that it focused on the disaster and any drama was a natural effect of the chaos in trying to respond to it.  Anyway, that’s my symposium on giant monster movies.  As for Kong: Skull Island… I actually did like it.  First of all, while there was some character drama wedged in there, most of the characters were much more likable and the cast was great.  I like anything with John Goodman and the highlight of the movie is John C Reilly.  The actual plot and story is not too far off from the original King Kong.  Traveling to an island, revealing King Kong, King Kong fighting other monsters on the island.  So in that way, it’s like an updated version of the original, although this one ends up being more about escaping the island rather than capturing him.  I also liked that this took place in the Vietnam war era.. it doesn’t change too much in the story, but it makes the soundtrack better (Black Sabbath and two Creedence songs and neither of them were Fortunate Son, huh).  Well anyway, I’m rambling now, but one last thing.. the creatures all looked pretty good to me, the CGI seemed pretty well done.. it made King Kong seem believable as a giant gorilla.  It’s a pretty run-of-the-mill Hollywood action/adventure but it does certain things well enough to stand out for me.",

      "Why randomly the 5th movie in the Harry Potter series, you might ask.  I bought an 8-film blu-ray set on eBay for cheaper than I saw it on Amazon thinking I got a good deal.  However, the discs all seem very.. different, no real consistency and there was a duplicate copy of the 4th film instead of the 5th.  So I’m thinking it’s a bootleg.. the dark spot of my movie collection.  Shame!  Shame!  Anyway, so I ended up seeing all but the Order of the Phoenix and bought it individually used later on.  So finally I’ve completed the Harry Potter journey.  I’m not really a Harry Potter guy.. I’m a <strong>Lord of the Rings </strong>trilogy man myself.  I didn’t grow up with either, so I don’t really have nostalgia either way.  I just prefer something a little less kid-oriented with a premise that feels a bit more universal.. I feel I can relate more to a hobbit on a journey to complete a quest than a kid who becomes a wizard.  Anyway, all that to say the Harry Potter movies are solid movies, but I lack that attachment that many people have who read the books or saw the movies when they were younger.  The middle films suffer the most for me.. not as fun and imaginative as the first ones and not as significant as the last ones.  I skipped from the 4th to 6th and, aside from a few key moments, I wouldn’t have even known there was a 5th movie between those two.  Still, I don’t dislike the movie.. the effects and settings are always great and it is a fun and creative world, but the plot and the characters don’t quite grab me",

      "I liked this one about on the same level as <strong>Superman</strong>.  They were similar in some ways.. a kind of “too” heroic/good protagonist, a similar “look” (though really different settings) and the typical “hero saves the girl” type scenario.  Where they differed was that I enjoyed the Superman story more, but the effects were pretty dated.. while with Clash of the Titans, I wasn’t as interested in the story and, though some effects were dated, the stop-motion and creatures were pretty cool.  So it kind of balanced out.  One cool thing that Clash of the Titans had was a golden owl helper.. C3POwl.  All in all, I think the mythological setting, characters and creatures are cool, the story gets a little slow here and there and the characters are pretty bland, but it’s still a fun watch.",

      "I’m gonna level with you.. I had never seen a Superman movie or TV show in my life.  But being THE superhero, I was pretty familiar with him, some backstory, his powers, etc.  So when I watched the movie, it wasn’t really “new” to me, except some of the details.  It’s a fun movie (fitting for the “Fun” Adventures category), but it does take a while to get going.  There is a lot of backstory and setup when I was just waiting to see the actual Superman stuff.  Once it gets to actual Superman mode, it’s fun.. but also very cartoonish (ok yeah I know, it’s a comic after all).  The villain and his bumbling sidekick, the cheesy Superman lines and the overly ridiculous powers all feel like those old 60s/70s cartoons in live action form.  It’s not really a criticism.. although, for me, I still prefer something just a <em>little</em> more realistic.  I can see why people would love it at the time, but it doesn’t age as well as some other movies from the era",

      "The final western for this watchlist.. for a lazy afternoon type of western, this one is all right.  Otherwise, it’s nothing special.  <strong>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</strong> is one of my favorite westerns and definitely my favorite of the “older” Hollywood-style western (before the genre changed with Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood, etc).  What I liked about the original (and a reason I like the OG <strong>Seven Samurai (1954)</strong>) is because the variety of characters.  How they are introduced, their specific skills and traits and their individual journey throughout the movie.  In The Magnificent Seven Ride, I didn’t get that so much.  It’s really more of a <strong>Dirty Dozen (1967)</strong> type of movie.  A group of prisoners have a chance to fight for their freedom, but with low odds of surviving.  So it’s fine but not really original or anything new, especially if you’ve seen quite a few westerns.  Still, it’s got Lee Van Cleef so you can’t go totally wrong.",

It’s a pretty simple premise.. he is a prisoner that has value as a hunter so he is hired to help hunt someone.  The rest of the movie is pretty much that pursuit.  I guess where it falls flat for me is that it feels kind of.. basic.  Maybe unoriginal.  It’s still fun and not bad, but there’s nothing about it that really separates it from any other movie with a similar plot.  It’s still not bad, but just a little “empty” if that makes any sense.",

I’m used to him as the silent, mysterious type, but in this one, he is a little more talkative and, of course, there is a bit more character relationship than his other westerns.  I tend to prefer the mysterious type a bit better, but this style had some good moments.  It’s basically a “buddy” movie, sort of like a buddy cop movie, where the two of them have to work together to make it to their destination.  Clint Eastwood’s character is on his way to some French garrison basically out of a chance to make money and he rescues Sister Sara and helps her get there too, since she is heading that direction anyway.  It’s fun overall, but I don’t really need the relationship aspect in my old westerns.. just personal preference.",

      "Or <strong>Sartana the Gravedigger</strong> in some circles.  It was kind of confusing to figure out which movie is which among the Sartana series, especially with alternate titles.  This one was pretty fun.  The premise is that “Sartana” and a gang rob a bank for $300,000 and a $10,000 bounty is put on his head, causing several people to come after him, seeking the bounty.  Why I use quotes around “Sartana” is because it was not actually him, but someone pretending to be him.   The real Sartana doesn’t like that very much and goes on a hunt to find out who did it.  It’s a good premise since it gives you an excuse to go from place to place, gunfighting and what not.. but also a little bit of that investigation/mystery feel.  Because of the time it was made and the fact that it’s Italian, I got some giallo vibes from it.  All in all, a fun movie, but I still can’t get over the fact that Sartana is just <em>too</em> powerful, so there is never a lot of suspense about whether he’ll survive.  He wins every fight easily without a struggle.  The movie is a little cartoon-ish in that way and some of the things he does, but I guess that’s part of the fun.",

      "Here we go with Old Western #1.  Of course, this happens to be the longest movie on the watchlist, clocking in at almost three and a half hours (!).  I like epic movies sometimes, but I was hoping to ease into the longer ones this watchlist.  But it’s all right, I liked the movie.  It really felt like<strong> Gone With the Wind (1939)</strong> but with a Texas ranch as the backdrop.. and also the main characters don’t seem to hate each other so much.  Like Gone With the Wind, time passes pretty quick in the movie.. from just meeting each other, to getting married, to having kids, the kids growing, etc.  While it is a Western in the geographical sense, it really doesn’t “feel” much like a classic western.  It’s more like 1920-1950 range.. cars, planes, all that.  Even though it wasn’t quite what I expected of a western, the movie was still entertaining throughout and it was nice to see a relationship that’s a little more realistic and not too sugar-coated.  Also, this is the first James Dean movie I’ve watched and his character was.. ok.  I felt like he could have been fleshed out more.

Like that movie, it has some internal conflicts here and there and there’s a psychological/paranoia element to it.  But this one has a much less defined “struggle”, if that’s the right term.  In The Thing, it’s clear what is happening and it gives meaning and impact to everything that happens.  In The Last Winter, it’s more of a mysterious “something” out in the snow.  Maybe it’s a personal preference, but I like the clearer idea of what’s happening.  The cast is pretty good, some recognizable faces, but there’s some pretty cheesy CGI that kind of ruins the mood.  I still like the setting and the overall feel of the movie, and this was definitely a little more activity than the previous Fessenden films, but it didn’t <em>quite</em> reach the heights I hoped for.

However, this movie has a surprisingly good cast with a lot of recognizable actors.  The basic premise is that a ship crew heads out to find some crashed/lost ship, where they see visions and g-g-ghoosts.  It’s got that typical crew banter relationship (like <strong>Alien (1979)</strong>, <strong>Aliens (1986)</strong> or some movies I watched in my first watchlist, <strong>Leviathan (1989) </strong>is a good example).  Actually, even though the major aspects of the movies are not so similar, this kind of reminded me of Leviathan but made in a different era.  Instead of infectious creatures in Leviathan, its ghosts here.  Anyway, that’s a bit of a tangent.. the movie is not so interesting, even with some twists here and there.

Lewis movies are the kind that I can appreciate for what they did for horror movies at the time, but I find them a little bit less and less fun to watch each time I watch one.  <strong>Blood Feast (1963) </strong>was not good but it was kind of bizarre, which made it interesting.  <strong>Two Thousand Maniacs (1964)</strong> was actually kind of decent, even though all of the “production quality” aspects were fairly poor.

What I find about certain types of movies.. giallos, classic Universal, Hammer especially… is that I have a kind of range that most movies will fall into.  For example, most Universal movies, for me, will fall into the 5-7 range, Hammer would be 6-7 and giallo movies will be around that same range.  I guess it’s because each one has a specific formula and feel, so it’s just the details that make any difference.  For this giallo, it follows the template, but it’s in a cozier location, some kind of bed and breakfast place in the woods.  Otherwise, it’s all the same giallo tropes so it ends up being ok and I will probably forget about except the setting.. and the unusual amount of bare old man asses.  Anyway, it ends up falling in that bucket of serviceable gialli that scratch the itch but aren’t <em>great</em>",

      "We’re in the home stretch, the last group of 8.  First up is another of the <strong>Invisible Man</strong> series.  While it’s better than <strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> <strong>(1940)</strong>, I’m still not really into these Universal monster series being so non-horror.  This time, it’s a WW2-era movie, so of course it’s about fighting Nazis and a using the invisibility to help America win!  It’s pretty predictable and of course it has the romantic tension side story, so this isn’t a really unique movie.  The main props I would give it is for the special effects.  I think that’s the main thing these Invisible movies have going for them.  Anyway, some of it looks a little funny now but overall, some of the tricks they pulled off still work all right.

      "If you’ve seen one Phantom of the Opera movie, you’ve probably seen them all, more or less.  So this one wasn’t anything new, but it is good.  I enjoyed it more than Universal’s 1943 version and I only vaguely remember the 1925 version.  This one does a good job of making the phantom a tragic character that you sympathize with, mainly because that opera owner guy is such a bastard.  The sets, the colors, the style is all very Hammer, so that’s good.  A personal drawback for me with these movies is just.. I’m not an opera guy.  It’s hard to finally get that off my chest… but there it is.  Musicals (movies, stage plays, operas, anything) are just not my cup of tea.  In this movie, the musical aspect is minimal enough to not feel like I’m watching a full-fledged musical, but there are a few scenes.  There’s something I kind of dig about this underground phantom lair that makes me enjoy this a little more than most other Hammer movies (although I think vampires and Frankenstein monsters are cooler creatures)",

Wendigo is deliberately slow paced and builds up tension and atmosphere while Serial Mom is quick and there’s always something happening.  I guess in the end, I’ll have to trust the numbers and go with <strong>Wendigo</strong>, even though, months or years from now, I may end up finding that I prefer Serial Mom more.. but Wendigo just stuck with me more.  So there you go, throw another Fessenden on the pile.  That’s three groups down and all three winners of the groups have been his movies, but this time it was close.",

Maybe it’s the comedy horror aspect or that I didn’t really know what to expect.  But finally I watched it and I was missing out.  It’s not the BEST movie ever or anything, but it’s really entertaining.  As the title implies, it’s about a mom who is a serial killer.  In my head, I expected it to be about a mom who gradually goes from normal to crazy.. but she is pretty much crazy from the start.  It’s more fun this way, especially with how good Kathleen Turner plays the mom.  The big plus for me in this movie is its setting.. mid-90s suburban town.  They have things like swap meets and video rental store.  Tonally, it’s pretty similar to the previous comedy horror I watched, <strong>Elvia, Mistress of the Dark</strong>.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this and it was pretty fun throughout.",

Oddly enough, this is fourth whodunit murder mystery in a row in this watchlist with a reveal at the end.  I expected it of the slashers and the giallos, sure, but not so much Universal and H.G. Lewis.  The gore here is about what I’ve come to expect with these movies, although it seems like there is a little bit less of it this time.  The tone is pretty goofy and there are about a million times a woman walks into a room where another had just been killed and then screams when she sees what happened.  It gets pretty ridiculous.  The main guy is overly cool and calm, maybe he is supposed to be a parody.

Anyway, there are a lot of movies called <strong>The Black Cat</strong> and they all seem to have different plots.  From those that I’ve seen, I think the Dario Argento segment from <strong>Two Evil Eyes (1990)</strong> is fundamentally closer to the original Poe story, though modernized.  This one is more of a murder mystery in a mansion style of movie, which is always fun.  It had potential but it’s a little goofy at times (another one of these butler/servant comedic relief characters).  All in all, it’s got the atmosphere and the setup, but it’s only ok on the execution.  Also, there is just a bit of Bela Lugosi, but not much so don’t expect too much there.",

By that I mean, it’s not some epic scope, across the country and through cities.. it’s mostly in a single location or two.  I really liked the opening, someone getting stranded due to a car breakdown, it’s storming out, she has to stay the night in some small little inn/restaurant.  Really good mood.

I originally bought the Scream Factory set as more of a completionist thing, but now I’m glad I did.  So far, every movie on there has been at least “pretty good” in my book, and this one was even better.  It’s actually a very “quiet” movie (slow, but not boring), but it hits a lot of the things I like: snow, isolation, small town vibe and subtlety.  The cast is good (cmon, Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle!) and everything is played out in a really subdued, realistic way.  The premise is simple.. a family with one kid is on their way to some snowy retreat when they hit a deer in the road which was being hunted and one of the hunter is kind of pissed off about it.  From there, it’s more drama than horror, but for someone who isn’t expecting a monster fest (the title IS Wendigo..) and can accept something slower paced, it’s pretty great",

There are a couple late 90s actors as well with Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Shannon and it has some goofy CGI here and there.  The main thing that I really didn’t like about this movie was the editing.. so many cuts and quick flashes of ghosts.. I just want to SEE the things, not these little 0.5 second flashes.

      "I’m back baby!  I didn’t die while skiing so I consider that a plus.  Back home now and stuck in a snowstorm, what better way to escape the cold than to watch a slasher-in-the-woods movie.  Aren’t woodsy slashers one of the most “summery” things out there?  In the world of slasher-in-the-woods, there is of course the <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> series and I have a soft spot for <strong>Sleepaway Camp (1983)</strong>.  <strong>The Burning (1981)</strong> is good and <strong>Madman</strong> <strong>(1981)</strong> is.. all right.  Below those is <strong>The Prey (1983)</strong> that I just watched in the first round of this March Madness.  And below that is <strong>Don’t Go in the Woods</strong>.  Why doesn’t it live up to the others?  Well its production quality is pretty low, even by 80s slasher standards, the characters have whatever the opposite of charisma is and the kills are pretty lame.  I’m sure a lot of it comes down to budget.. the kills are generally off-screen with just a splash of bright red blood after the fact.  There isn’t much else to this movie, just a few campers hiking in the wilderness and people go missing and the park rangers have to go investigate.  As an aside, I really prefer the slashers-in-the-woods that are based around campgrounds and cabins.  There’s something interesting about the contrast between the fun, cozy cabins and the threat of the killer.  Anyway, enough of my rambling, I guess because I didn’t watch and write about a movie for over a week, I couldn’t help myself.. although I barely talked about <em>this </em>particular movie at all.. and it makes sense, it’s not a very significant or memorable one.",

      "Giallos (at least the 10ish I’ve seen..) always seem to be pretty decent quality.  Fun mysteries, good European backdrops and they always look good.  I don’t watch the movies trying to solve it myself, though I can get why that’s fun for some.. but I just go along for the ride.  Anyway, this particular giallo spends time in Greece, which is a little different.  A woman’s husband dies in a plane crash and she is left with a lot of money, which is suspicious, but then the typical black-gloved killer starts doing his thing.  What’s funny here is that the killer’s outfit is like.. all black glove.  I mean, his entire body, covered in black.  Almost like the gimp from <strong>Pulp Fiction (1994)</strong> but.. not quite.  Not much else to say except it hit that 70s/giallo vibe I like.",

So there you go, <strong>No Telling</strong> is the survivor of the first group of movies.  Just for fun, I’d rank them something like:",

This one confirms that.  While I do enjoy that it’s just fun and not meant to be taken seriously, I just don’t find the jokes landing.  There’s some potential.. the disguise guy somehow fooling people (and tomatoes), but at most, these kinds of jokes get like a slight exhale of air from my nose.  One thing that I did appreciate about this movie is the late 70s style.. some of the styles of those rooms, like the all-green room… pretty awesome.  I appreciate them doing something fun and trying to be creative with what they had, but it’s just not my humor.",

In this one, you don’t have THE Dracula, so, similar to <strong>Dracula’s Daughter</strong>, it just didn’t feel like it was a Dracula movie.  Although, there was Peter Cushing as Van Helsing to help connect it.  As a latecomer to old Universal and Hammer, I feel I just don’t “get” the movies like many horror fans do.  But that’s not to say I dislike them, they are solid just for the atmosphere alone.  I guess it’s just that, the older the movie, the farther away it is for me and it’s just harder to relate.",

I was expecting something a lot more horrific, maybe cheap effects and trashy fun, but this was a lot more “artsy” than I anticipated.  The premise is a couple moves out to the country for a while, trying to have a baby but can’t, the husband’s a scientist really devoted to his work and the wife is an artist.  The beginning felt like a Stephen King adaptation for some reason.  The rest of the movie is mostly a relationship drama with some horrific elements worked in, but really not much.  Some scenes with animals definitely made me more uncomfortable than horror movies generally do, so it was not an easy watch.  Also, the music was surprisingly beautiful.  In the end, I didn’t get what I was expecting at all, but as a more artsy drama with a bit of horror, it was pretty good.",

      "I wanted to make sure I got this one in early since Valentine’s Day is coming up in a little over a week so I put it in the first group of 8 movies and I won’t be able to watch any for about a week when I’m out of town trying (and failing) to ski.  I’ve watched it now, so mission accomplished.  It’s a slasher that definitely was riding the wave of the post-<strong>Scream (1996)</strong> era of slashers.  It sticks to the formula pretty well.. there’s a past incident that leads to the present-day slashings, the identity of the killer is kept a mystery and the killer wears a mask, although it’s a <em>little</em> goofy.  However, for 80s slashers fans, they’d be disappointed that there is basically no gore effects or senseless nudity… but it’s a different era.  The characters are fine, some a little unlikeable, but not too memorable, especially the final girl, if you want to call her that.  In the end, it’s a good enough early 2000s slasher and it’s a rare holiday-themed horror movie that isn’t Christmas or Halloween.",

      "Well… this is an interesting watch in 2021.  The maniacs here are a bunch of Confederate-flag-waving southerners who lure a group of victims into their small town to kill them in elaborate and bloody ways.  They do this as some kind of 100 year anniversary/ritual related to the end of the US Civil War.  Maybe a sequel in 2065..?  Despite its cheap appearance, it’s actually not a bad movie.  Of course, being an HG Lewis movie, it’s gorey, especially for the early part of the 1960s.  The maniacs were pretty creepy in their own way, “friendly” the whole time.  It’s a movie worth watching even almost 60 years later..

      "Yeah I know it’s not even close to March yet but shh.  This is the first movie of the watchlist and it was technically released in 1983 but I read that it was actually filmed in 1979/1980, which is funny because it has an obvious similarity to <strong>Friday the 13th (1980)</strong> and other slashers in the woods, but this was made before the slasher trend took off.  You’ve got a monstrous killer who was affected by some decades-earlier tragedy.. people are picked off one-at-a-time and there is some decent gore.  So as far as slashers go, this is all right, but with that comes the standard uninteresting characters, some…ok… acting and some awkward shots, like there was some slow-motion part that I found pretty funny.  Also, the killer seems to kind of “roar”..?  Oh and I found the music in here really similar to some of the music from <strong>The Shining (1980)</strong>… probably coincidence.

The action parts are fairly short and not very dramatic (ok, maybe the ending sequence..)  Really the story is more drama, focusing on the main character and his girlfriend and son.  It’s a little slow at first but it’s interesting to see this family as they move from place to place and bond a little.  I could have used a <em>little</em> bit more of that, since part of the point of the movie is to make you care about the main characters.  And I want to know what happened to the dog.

The plot is a little weird.. basically female virgins are being attacked/raped by some creature and a detective and doctor are trying to figure out what’s going on.  That’s basically it.

However, if you are hoping for a wasp woman, skip to the last 3 minutes of the movie and you’ve basically seen it all… the rest of the movie is just.. nothingness.  A void.  Well, not really, but it’s just a lot of uninteresting talk about a scientist that many don’t trust and a discovery he makes that helps the businesswoman look younger.. but I guess you can imagine what happens.

Though, it’s really more like bigfoot and I don’t recall there being any snow.. Lloyd Braun is a guy who is wheelchair-bound and watches a group of vacationing girls through the window.  Basically, take <strong>Rear Window (1954)</strong> but with Lloyd Braun, add the girls trip element of <strong>The Descent (2005)</strong>, but if the girls were more annoying and worse actresses and add in a bigfoot type creature and basically that’s the movie.  There are also a couple really small roles for some horror icons.. Dee Wallace, Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen, so it definitely seems like it’s made by horror fans and not just a cheap cash-in.

      "Surprisingly, I’ve never seen any Alien movies after <strong>Alien (1979)</strong> and <strong>Aliens (1986)</strong>, unless you count <strong>Prometheus (2012)</strong>.  I guess because I always heard a lot about those and never heard much about the others, so I just ignored them.  But I do have the VHS tapes for this and <strong>Alien Resurrection (1997)</strong>, so someday I’ll get around to that one.  Anyway, enough of my Alien viewing history.  Alien 3 is basically all right.  It’s not as timeless as <strong>Alien</strong> and the action and characters aren’t as good as <strong>Aliens</strong>.  It’s a pretty dreary movie, taking place on some prison colony in space and, yeah, that orange-yellow tint gets kind of old.  Some characters are kind of over-the-top, some are too serious but nothing too bad.  There’s a little bit of CGI/green screening effects that don’t hold up well.. but in the end, it works pretty well as a kind of conclusion to the first two movies.  In that sense, the first three Alien movies make a pretty decent trilogy and you could just end it right there.  I do know that <strong>Alien Resurrection</strong> kind of.. messes that up, but I think of it a bit like the Halloween series.  You could watch <strong>Halloween (1978), Halloween 2 (1981)</strong> and <strong>Halloween: H20 (1998)</strong> and call that the Laurie Strode trilogy.  But.. if you have to… you can go onto <strong>Halloween: Resurrection (2002)</strong>.. also “Resurrection”.. huh.

So while it’s a bit uneventful, it still seems like one of those “rainy afternoon movies” to me where I could just throw it on in the background.",

      "Starting the “randomizer” watchlist with a Stephen King adaptation.  This might have fit into my “Stephen King Non-Horror” theme from a few weeks ago since it’s not really horror, more of a suspense.  This is one of those rare cases where I had actually already read the source material before seeing the movie and I think that kind of hinders the viewing experience.  The premise is an interesting one and the cast is pretty decent, but it’s not really a story that needs to be a full-length movie.  I’m sure I’ve complained about this several times in other Stephen King short story adaptations but.. I’m doing it again anyway.  It’s an easy enough watch though and they didn’t do anything too egregious with the adaptation.  I was worried that it would have some younger married couple as the main characters to appeal to a younger audience, which would kind of ruin the whole point of the story.. but luckily, they stuck to the story.  It’s ok but I think I would forget ever having seen it if it wasn’t attached to Stephen King’s name.",

      "Well, that’s it.  The last of the Gamera movies.  If it’s the last one they ever make, then it’s a pretty decent farewell since it’s kind of a modern-day throwback to those old kid-centric movies.  For that reason though, it’s not really my style, but it is better than the old ones.  Unfortunately, in this one, the “new Gamera” is still a growing turtle, so he looks pretty goofy.  The enemy monster looks pretty cool, kind of a dragon with a spiny back (but the CGI of its “tongue” was distracting).  I would have really liked to see what a more matured/advanced Gamera would look like in a post-2000 movie but.. oh well.  Otherwise, the movie is fine but a little too much stuff with the main boy and his pet turtle.  Some Gamera movies are good, some are bad…. this one was OK.",

      "I started out liking this less than the previous two, mainly because there was too much focus on the high school kids and their drama and blah blah.  But the final 20 minutes or so of the movie were awesome enough to overcome that, so I would put this higher than those.  Higher than any of the previous Gamera movies, for that matter.. but even then, the movie as a whole is just “good”, but if they could have combined some of the stuff from the other two 90s Gamera movies with the ending of this one, I think there’d be a great movie in there somewhere.  The enemy monster design was pretty cool and looked like something from Final Fantasy, although the late 90s CGI dated it a bit in some places.  Anyway, only one more movie left to go, but as it stands, this would be my go-to Gamera movie.",

The monster effects are similar and there are some decent fight scenes with the villain monster, but sometimes the “monster physics” (not sure how to describe that) look funny.  Like.. the speed of the monsters movement doesn’t quite give the impression that they are these giant monsters?  I don’t now, but anyway, again it fits my style a bit more since it’s treated like a serious emergency.  There is also a surprisingly bloody kill in a subway tunnel.

Definitely a step up from the others, but the monsters still look a little funny, but closer to realistic.  I prefer the more serious approach to a monster movie, treating it like a real disaster, so this one is better for my preferences.  This movie has things like like emergency news bulletins, city evacuations, etc.  Anyway, I’m curious to see the next three Gamera movies.

      "So it’s come to this:  A Gamera clip show.  Basically, that’s all this is.  After watching seven the preceding seven Gamera movies within a few weeks of watching this, it makes it much worse since I’m just watching a lot of old footage that I <em>just</em> saw.  I’ve run into something similar before with <strong>Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2 (1987)</strong>, where half of the movie is just flashbacks to the first movie.  However, the non-flashback part of that movie gave us “Garbage daaay!” so.. how can I hate it.  In this movie, there is some typical alien girls subplot with a typical little kid who summons Gamera.  Then they watch Gamera fight all the old monsters, which is just old footage repurposed as if they were new fights.  Pretty lame.  Anyway, I guess for someone who doesn’t want to watch seven Gamera movies, they could just watch this one and call it good.. but then they’d miss out on the Gamera song.  This one has the “Gamera March” in its place and it’s not as memorable.  So, not really a good movie but it’s ok as a summary or clip show.",

      "Not to spoil the ending, but Gamera plays the enemy monster’s spinal fins like a xylophone and plays part of his own theme song and then dances.. has Godzilla ever done that?  Case closed.  Anyway, this movie is about as bad as that sounds.  The kids in this are somehow even more annoying than the others, maybe because they are too young so their “acting” is worse.  Also, the alien woman has to be the clumsiest alien I’ve ever seen in a movie.  There is a bit of fighting between the two monsters, but nothing really spectacular.  This time it’s an underwater monster, so a lot of their interactions are in the water so it’s kind of limited on what they can do.  Zigra looks a little better than some of those other dumb monsters but..still not very cool.  All in all, probably my least favorite Gamera movie so far just because it’s kind of embarrassingly bad at some points.  Looks like this is the last of the “original” Gamera movies.  They released seven of them, one per year over seven years.  Next up is one from 1980, so I’ll be curious to see if there is a shift in the style.  I hope so..",

Although, at least this one spent a little more time with the city’s response to the monsters and a <em>little</em> less on the kids, so that’s a positive.  Also, it seemed like there was more monster fighting here than the previous couple, but maybe that’s just my imagination.  Jiger, which is basically some triceratops creature, is not a very well-designed creature.. but it’s one of the more destructive monsters in the series, so at least it’s more of a threat.  Aside from the cheesy effects, the movie isn’t so bad but I’m a little bit tired of the “we adults need to base our life-or-death choices based on what these kids say” thing.  But it’s an improvement over the previous couple movies and, at halfway through the series, I needed a little bit of a change in the positive direction..",

A couple of kids get in a vehicle they shouldn’t, ultimately end up aboard some spaceship or base and Gamera has to come and save the day.  I will say, I don’t think these kids yelled “Gamera!  Gamera!” quite so much, but the Gamera theme song was used a couple times..  “You’re so strong Gamera!”  As far as Guiron the monster goes, it’s a crawling reptile with a giant knife on its head.  I think they were intentionally making the monsters look dumb at this point.  Anyway, I’m ready for a change in the formula.  My understanding is that the “newer” (still like 20+ years old by now) Gamera films are actually decent, but I won’t get there for a few more movies so… I’ll just wait patiently.",

It’s basically the misadventures of two boy scouts who somehow know and can do things that adults can’t.. it just happens that their misadventures cross paths with Gamera and some bumblebee alien ship thing that is trying to adbuct/control Gamera or something.  Anyway, Viras appears near the end and it’s another dumb-looking monster, even worse than Gyaos to me.  I’m curious who designed these monsters and what grade they were in.  They really look like someone took some kid’s drawings of monsters and literally transformed them into puppets.  Also, there’s <em>even more</em> “Gamera! Gamera!” yelling from the kids.  Only four movies in an that’s already wearing me out.

Watching these after having watched the first 5 or so Godzilla movies really makes this all feel too familiar.  But at least this one had a monster for Gamera to fight.  Also, Barugon can freeze things, which is kind of nice since it seems like most monsters tend to just spit fire.  All in all, the monster fight was a plus but I was less excited watching the first half with some guys looking for a treasure (they goofed up since that lead to Barugon hatching), so it ends up being roughly the same overall rating from me.",

Ok, maybe not “running”.. he’s a giant turtle, which is kind of a strange choice for a giant monster.

I don’t remember it being Christmas-themed at all, so I thought maybe for part 4 they got back to basics but no, not at all.  It’s annoying that they even advertised it as such.  When the movie started, Clint Howard was pumped that he found a half-eaten hamburger and so I thought this was going places.  In the end, the movie is more of a cult movie with about 3 minutes of small Christmas decorations in the background and Clint Howard watching some kind of pseudo-Silent Night Deadly Night movie on TV.

Basically, some killer was executed years ago, his spirit can “escape” the cemetery each anniversary of his execution and if someone doesn’t hold their breath driving by the cemetery, guess what.

I enjoyed the movie for those elements and because of the cast.  It was bittersweet to see such a little Anton Yelchin playing the lead role and he was pretty good.

      "Onto a new theme: non-horror movies based on Stephen King stories.  Some of my favorite movies of all time fall under this category. <strong>Stand By Me (1986)</strong>, <strong>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</strong>, and <strong>The Green Mile (1999)</strong>.  Of course, I like a lot of the horror movies made based on his work, but with horror in general, the quality is pretty hit-or-miss.  Anyway, I have a lot of (almost all of?  Minus sequels, etc) Stephen King movies on blu-ray, DVD and VHS, but I could only find three that I hadn’t seen that looked like they weren’t really horror at all and Dolores Claiborne is the earliest of those.  This is one that has no supernatural element at all.. it’s just a straight drama about a older mother accused of killing a woman for whom she had been a live-in caregiver (hey I used ‘whom’ correctly I think) and her adult journalist daughter who comes back home to find out what happened and try to help her out against the investigators.  It’s not too complicated but still ends up over 2 hours long, but that’s mostly because there are several flashbacks.  In the end, it’s pretty good if a bit slow sometimes.  The cast is the main reason I enjoyed it, especially Kathy Bates.  And of course, Mainer accents.  It’s a good movie if you like family drama.",

While that one was darker in some ways, this one is kind of depressing all around.  It’s also in black and white, which makes the whole thing seem more depressing.  This is another one from Shinya Tsukamoto and I’m happy I bought that Arrow set, there have been some interesting films.  I look forward to watching the rest in the set.. but that’s for another watchlist probably.",

      "Pretty dark and weird, which isn’t bad but.. there are definitely some awkward parts if you are watching with anyone else.  Aside from going pretty wild sometimes, there isn’t too much that sticks out for me.  Story-wise, it’s kind of a typical police officer fighting a gang leader.  But the real reason to watch is just for the atmosphere, the characters and the locations.  One notable thing about this release is that they make what could be confusing much more understandable by differentiating the subtitles when speaking different languages (ie “This sentence” vs “[This sentence]” vs “{This sentence}” all represent a different language being spoken).  It has some significance so I’m glad it was done that way, it made it easy for a dumb American like me.",

      "Onto a new theme, Japanese Action movies.  The first one the second in a series in which I’ve only seen the first movie.  I’m not sure what a Gangster VIP is but.. sure.  Anyway, this is an interesting transition from the Western theme because this movie feels so much like a Western that just happens to take place in 1950s Japan.  The main character is basically the same:  an unusually skilled fighter in a kind of one-vs-many scenario, except he uses a knife instead of guns.  The “Gangster” part of the title is that he was in the mafia, the “Outlaw” part I guess is because he tried to get out of that life but still has to fight and pay debts.  The “VIP” part..?  Anyway, this has the same entertainment value as something like <strong>Sartana</strong>, but the knife fights are sort of clumsy and less impressive than gunfights.  I can’t get over the trope (Kung Fu movies do this too) where the bad guys just go after him one at a time and the others patiently wait.  It’s a little awkward here.. they could have killed him easily.. many times… anyway, still a good watch.",

      "I like movies with short succinct titles like this.  Of course, it’s a spaghetti western, which is probably why the title is a paragraph in itself.  Being a spaghetti western, it’s a lot different than the two westerns I watched before this.  Those are old Hollywood epics and this is dirtier and morally gray.  It’s a much smaller story about stealing gold and stealing the stolen gold and justice and blah blah.  After the <strong>Dollars</strong> trilogy and <strong>Django (1966)</strong>, I guess this isn’t really anything new.  Although I think they take it to the extreme in how good of a gunman Sartana is.  Like, yeah, I get it, he is supposed to be good but he is a little <em>too</em> unbelievably fast and accurate.  But just for watching a nearly invincible gunman fight bandits, this is pretty much all I could expect.",

Also, there are a lot of notable actors in it.. but like <strong>The Alamo</strong>, it has that old Hollywood “shine” on it to make everything look a little too clean.  I know it’s just the time it was made and for what it is (a old-style western/epic) it’s enjoyable.  I generally like films with a format that spans a long period of time, checking in every few years.. so this gets points for that, but overall I think the idea could be done better, especially in a more “realistic” way, not something so clean-cut.",

      "The new theme is Westerns.. pretty straightforward.  I’ve been a fan of Westerns since I was a kid, all because of a PC adventure game called <strong>Dust: A Tale of the Wired West</strong>.  Anyway, I like those “grey area” Westerns where it’s not so much “good guys” and “bad guys”… even the good guys aren’t really that good (<strong>The Good the Bad and the Ugly (1966) </strong>and <strong>Unforgiven (1992)</strong> are my favorites).  I’m not as into those old “fun” westerns before the Spaghetti western era, except I do really like <strong>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</strong>.  All that to say, The Alamo falls into that latter category.. a little bit too “heroic” and the good guys a little too good.  But even still, the characters were really enjoyable and it is fun.  Also, to be fair, I had issues with the disc so I missed a few chapters in the middle, so maybe I missed a few things.  Overall though, I still enjoyed the movie and might look into getting a blu-ray copy of this, if one exists, since this is a DVD that came in a giant collection of United Artists films.  So despite it being a little too old-fashioned and on-the-nose in its message, it’s still a good watch to me.",

Though he wasn’t a major part of this movie.. it’s funny that so far 5 out of 6 movies in this watchlist have been either De Niro or Sean Bean.  “Funny” in an “only I find it interesting” kind of way.  Anyway, this movie is all right, especially if you are into those European crime/heist movies with lots of twists and turns and double crosses.  It’s fairly solid in that respect, but for some reason, there is a kind of “flatness” to it.. something about the characters and the interactions.

      "The new theme on the block: Arrow Crime.  I have a lot of movies released by Arrow films since they specialize in 70s/80s horror and action.  Right up my alley, but that means I have a big backlog to get through.  So this theme will help me get through three of them.  The first one, <strong>Cruising</strong>, is one I’d never heard of until Arrow released it.  I can kind of see why it didn’t become a big classic given it’s focus around a controversial community.. the heavy leather and S&amp;M gay scene.  These guys are wild!  I don’t know if these clubs are like that in real life but man.. it’s wild.  Anyway, the movie is a murder mystery within that scene with Al Pacino as an undercover cop.  It’s a good movie but I felt like some things were missing and, based on what I read after, that’s true.  Sounds like a lot of footage had to be cut and permanently destroyed.  Despite Pacino being the main character and having plenty of screen-time, I felt like it might have been nice to “know” his character more.  Anyway, the movie could have been better with extra footage to make some things make a bit more sense, but even still, it was pretty good.  My favorite part was the interrogation “intimidator”.. or whatever he was.  “Who is that guy??”",

      "Here’s the last movie of this set.  The first two felt more like experiments where this one feels like the first “actual” movie.  Although this had some outside-the-box kind of stuff, like the play and just the general direction the movie went.  But it’s entertaining and still feels relevant.. and I can definitely see the early stages of Travis Bickle from <strong>Taxi Driver (1976)</strong> with De Niro here.  I always thought <strong>Taxi Driver</strong> and <strong>The King of Comedy (1982)</strong> seemed connected, almost like as if Travis Bickle tried to become a comedian but was still a little..unstable.  In that “universe”, I think <strong>Hi, Mom!</strong> could be a kind of prequel to those events.  While not as good as those movies, of course, it’s cool to see the real beginning of the De Niro that I’m familiar with.",

I know it’s a low budget amateur film, but filmed around the time that <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968) </strong>was filmed, this just doesn’t maintain my interest like that one does.

      "New watchlist, party time excellent.  The first set of three movies comes from this Arrow collection of early movies from Robert De Niro and Brian De Palma.  The first one is <strong>Greetings</strong>.  The best way I can describe it is sort of like an anthology of loosely connected scenes.  Things are somewhat connected through a “computer dating” story, which is pretty funny for the 60s.. While the comedy isn’t always that great to me, the movie is more interesting just for the era it’s made.  Things like Vietnam draft-dodging and the JFK conspiracy theories (which was probably the most entertaining part to me).  In the end, it felt a little aimless like.. “what’s the point here..?” but maybe the point is just to be funny and comment on the times.",

So here we are at #70, a strange one to end on.  As the name would suggest, it is a comedy.  The style of comedy is a <em>little</em> bit like a Mel Brooks movie but tamer.  There’s a bit of slapstick, too.  Normally, I would probably dislike something like this (from my experience with another comedy attempt like <strong>The Invisible Woman</strong>), but this has a list of horror stars who are good comedic actors too.  While the jokes were not always so great, the facial expressions and reactions of these guys were usually at least entertaining.

Fewer than that, they just linger too long and more than that are too short to get into anything before it’s over.  Twice Told Tales falls in the “fewer” category with three stories, which is not so bad in itself, but the movie is two hours, so that’s roughly 40 minutes per segment on average.  I liked the first segment the best with two older men finding a kind of youth elixir.  The second segment was a “forbidden love” type situation which had an interesting premise but dragged too much.  The final one is the House of the Seven Gables.  Great setting and everything, but again, just a bit too slow.

Fulci’s <strong>Zombie (1979)</strong> is good and <strong>Dawn of the Dead (1978)</strong> is my favorite horror movie of all time.  So slow, shuffling zombies are right up my alley and as soon as I saw the zombies in this movie, I was ready to go.  They move slow, they look decayed and gross.. that part is awesome.  But do you know who moves slower than the zombies?  The characters in the movie.  It gets a little old seeing people just stand there and gasp and not move while zombies slowly creep in.  So there was a lot of potential here if the characters were just interesting and acted like normal human beings would act.  That’s the whole point of zombie movies to me.. you have to be smart, act quickly and learn to survive, but even then, you still may be overrun.  George Romero’s movies are so good at that, but many others, including this movie, just don’t hit that note for me.  Anyway, thanks for coming to my Dead Talk.",

It definitely feels like a different decade than the previous movies this week, especially with the awesome soundtrack.. but in other ways, it still has that Italian mystery feel.  Maybe partially due to the “new girl arriving at a European school” premise that <strong>Suspiria (1977)</strong> has.  I could have used a little more Donald Pleasance, but at least his monkey came through in the clutch.

Also, instead of standing there paralyzed for 20 minutes looking at my movies trying to decide which one to watch and then ultimately just re-watching a movie I’ve seen many times, this forces me to work through my backlog of unseen but owned movies.  Instead of deliberating “is this really the movie I want to watch right now?”, I just look at the watchlist and say “this is the next one, let’s do it” and that’s very freeing.

They said they felt they needed to restore those scenes for a “film of this importance”.. anyway, it’s kind of fun to watch it that way, to see a 5-10 second segment of VHS quality video then back to HD, it makes you appreciate how far we’ve come with our technology.",

Like, the <strong>Nightmare on Elm Street</strong> series would flair out in the “supernatural” direction.. <strong>Dressed to Kill (1980) </strong>might be out towards a “thriller” direction.

This one is not like those.. I couldn’t tell you anyone’s name or any real character traits.. they are all basically just setup to be killed.  Even the final girl doesn’t have a very large role throughout most of it.  So as a slasher, it has the kills with fun special effects and the whodunit aspect, but it’s otherwise pretty forgettable.

About 10 minutes into this thing, I was about ready to start “Walking Dead” it.  By that, I mean, when I used to watch The Walking Dead, around season 5 I would fast-forward through the commercials (remember DVR..?) and if the fast-forward went a little too far past the end of the commercials and into the episode, I would think “oh that’s ok…”.  Shortly, I would actively let it fast-forward a little bit more into the episodes.  By season 6, I think I was just fast-forwarding through the entire episode until something happened.  I eventually gave up on the show altogether.  In this movie, I just wanted to fast-forward until something interesting happened.. but I didn’t, because this is a movie watching challenge and I’m a professional, I’ll rise above it.",

Like the movies from those filmmakers, it’s really about the build-up and great visuals.

There’s a difference between the “slowness” of this compared to something like <strong>The Rite</strong> that I watched earlier this week.  I think it comes down to how intrigued I was by the premise as well as being more artistically made, so even when I feel things are a little too slow, there is still something engaging to see or hear.

      "I had a feeling this wasn’t going to be my jam.  It’s not bad, just not the kind of movie that really interests me.  It’s strange because <strong>The Exorcist (1973)</strong> is a top 10 horror movie for me, but I’m not really into exorcism movies.  The two prequels to The Exorcist , <strong>Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) </strong>and <strong>Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005)</strong>, were both pretty boring to me.  This was in that same vein but a more interesting setting and Anthony Hopkins.  In the end, I was worried about this week because supernatural horror movies generally don’t do it for me.  Something about them being unrealistic but taking themselves so seriously.  It’s not like other horror genres are that realistic either, but generally they are at least fun.  All that to say, this movie, while not poorly made, just didn’t keep my interest.",

      "The premise here is pretty good: five people stuck on an elevator and one is supposedly the devil.  It reminds me a little bit of <strong>Saw (2004)</strong> in that there is the horror story (the elevator) wrapped with the detective trying to figure out what’s going on.  It makes for an interesting suspense movie and it’s mostly well done.  I’m not so much a big fan of the security guard who awkwardly and conveniently seems like he has a PhD in Devilology.  I think really his only purpose is to read exposition.  I wondered, after reading the premise, how people would just “know” there could be a devil in the elevator and I guess this their solution.. he just knows a <em>lot</em> about the devil.  “The devil does this..” and “the devil will do that..”  Anyway, just a little awkward to me, but overall it kept my attention and didn’t get TOO ridiculous.  It could have been a more ridiculous movie and called something like “Devilator”",

For some reason, especially with the cover art, I expected it to be more of a period piece, like a 1600s, 1700s New England ghost story but, it’s not that.  It is set in a New England town but otherwise it’s modern day.  There is a ghost woman, I’ll say that much and, if I had seen this when I was a kid, I’m sure the ghost woman imagery would have been imprinted in my brain.  But seeing this as an adult.. it doesn’t do much and I could have done without so much of the flashback.. anyway, an OK but not really good start to the supernatural week.",

I guess, until the late 40s and 50s sci-fi horror movies, crime was the popular “horror” subject.  Anyway, this doesn’t really make much sense in how a guy with half a brain transplant physically transforms between one guy or the other..?  But it’s ok.  It’s another Lugosi + Karloff movie but they don’t really interact or anything so don’t use that a selling point.  Overall, kind of meh but ok.  It seems like the Universal movies of the 40s dipped in quality compared to the 30s, but they still always have that relaxing, comfortable viewing experience.",

The effects were probably pretty cool back in the 1930s, mainly the glowing skin and a smoky/fiery death scene near the end.  The movie lost me a little in their trip to Africa.. did they refer to the baby as “this creature”?  Eeh… but after that, it’s a pretty typical old school “science gone too far” kind of thing.",

Putting that aside, it accomplishes what some of these other movies couldn’t, which is just being entertaining.  Maybe it’s because it stars Boris Karloff and he has a fun, loyal sidekick, Petty Louie.  Otherwise, it’s similar to the other ones (unnecessary romance sub-plot, criminals as the main villains, no deaths/monsters/scares), but it just does everything a little bit better.

With this title, I expected this would take place in a city, you know, maybe on a Market Street.  Instead, this largely takes place Where the Streets Have No Name, meaning, some island populated with a native group.  So, not quite what I expected, but it was an interesting enough premise.  Basically, this mad doctor convinces the natives that he has the ability to bring people back to life and therefore becomes revered by them.  That means he has them on his side and power over the island, including the others who shipwrecked there with him.  It’s an ok movie, but I have to deduct a bit because of “Aunt Margaret”.. what an annoying character.

Anyway, it’s always funny to see these stories about exploitation filmmakers who do anything to capitalize on the success of something else and it seems like he did a pretty good job of it.  Although none of the movies I watched this week are what I’d consider “good”, he made his movies with the budget and constraints that he had and was able to make them mostly entertaining and somewhat coherent, despite all of the editing and shuffling after filming.

I didn’t even know but I saw a Severin box set that I couldn’t pass up that had basically his whole filmography so.. here we are.  Basically, he directed a lot of b-level (or lower?) genre movies in the 60s and 70s, so I’m buckled in for some cheap exploitation films.  The first is Blood of Dracula’s Castle, which wasn’t as bad as I expected but it was about as cheap as I expected.  Lots of weird edits where I just assume someone got hit or punched but they cut so quickly, I guess to mask the fact that there was no budget for effects?  And one part, some vampires were aging rapidly and turning to dust, but you see them normally, then cut to the reactions of the “non-vampires” people saying “they’re suddenly growing old….now they are just dust!” and then cut back to their clothes just full of dust now.  Of course we would want to see this transformation but, it’s all right, movie, you tried.  Anyway, the plot: a couple goes to a castle of vampires (and some servants) where people are captured and used for blood.  If you are expecting vampires doing vampire things, you’ll be disappointed.  They are just well dressed people drinking “blood” out of wine glasses.  It’s a little slow but it’s watchable.",

Anyway, it’s really more of a drama but it’s a good one.  This is the third movie from the Tsukamoto set that I’ve seen and coming from the others (the <strong>Tetsuo</strong> movies), this was quite different.  There are some disturbing scenes (including a head shot, even if it was a hallucination, it was pretty shocking..)

It’s not very conventional, but at least it’s not boring.  There is something of a story here and it has some decent effects and stop motion that looks like the Sledgehammer music video (wait, Body <em>Hammer</em>.. Sledge<em>hammer</em>.  I think I’ve figured it all out).  The movie is kind of all over the place in it style.  First it’s like a normal early 90s action movie, with typical villains and even a lair of bad guys all training together.  Then it’s more abstract like the first movie, then some more “subdued” flashbacks.  And at least you get a fight scene with some creepy “happy birthday” singing.",

If there has to be some backstory to a monster, I prefer it happen upfront.. like with Jason’s backstory in the <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> series.  It just doesn’t make sense to me to try to make a scary character a sympathetic victim after its already been established as a scary evil being.  All that matters to me is that it’s some emotionless force of evil.  I find this kind of uninteresting in a similar way to those <strong>Exorcist</strong> prequels focusing on the priest.

Two Evil Eyes is sort of an anthology but with only two segments which is kind of unfortunate.  My understanding is that it was supposed to be more but then only George Romero and Dario Argento stayed with it.  So anyway, if it was a 4-5 movie anthology, these two would make better segments.  Kind of drawn out as they are.  I’d say I preferred the first (Romero) segment over the second (Argento).  It’s a bit zombie-ish but not <em>really</em>.  The second one focuses a lot on a cat and “creepy” cats are not really my thing (only a little with <strong>Pet Sematary (1989)</strong>).

I guess in the end, I’ll have to trust the numbers and go with <strong>Wendigo</strong>, even though, months or years from now, I may end up finding that I prefer Serial Mom more.. but Wendigo just stuck with me more.

Habit was a cool movie, it had its horrific aspects but a very “human” story.. if you take the horrific/monstrous aspects out of it, it’s a drama about an addictive and destructive relationship.  The Editor, as mentioned before, is an homage to horror fans, a very fun tribute to giallos and other genre movies.  For my personal taste, as goofy as my pick may be, I’m going to have to give this championship to… <strong>The Editor</strong>.  It’s really a surprise, but I guess it’s the kind of movie made for someone like me.  For others, it may not have much or any appeal, but I’m a horror nerd and they boomed me.",

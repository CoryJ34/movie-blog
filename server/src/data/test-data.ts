      "Back to this western two-pack blu-ray.  This one is similar in quality to the other, but a different type of story.  In this one, a well-liked Civil War captain is framed for treason, gets imprisoned, escapes and then gets his apparently 4 dollars worth of revenge on those responsible.  Simple enough, but it’s surprisingly kind of slow for a revenge premise.  Again, there’s the low technical quality, some awkward dubbing, all that kind of stuff.  I wouldn’t say I actively disliked it, just that there is nothing that really stands out.. no characters or actors, nothing stylish.  Just a really plain western, but sometimes that’s all you need.",

      "This was a weird prequel to <strong>Crocodile Dundee (1986)</strong>.  I’m sure I’m not the first to make that lame joke.  Anyway, this is more of a Civil War movie but definitely a western.  Charlton Heston is a Union Major and he has a task to bring together a group and go after some Apache leader.  He has to gather up some Confederate soldiers who have basically no choice but to join and then hijinks ensue.  It’s got a little bit of that “building up a crew” element that I like, but most of the movie is them camping out, getting along then not getting along then getting along again, stuff like that.  There’s a small romance subplot that didn’t seem to necessary.  Overall, though, it’s ok as a western but it seemed to drag a lot for me, like it wanted to be an epic but just wasn’t.  Maybe that’s my fault, I watched the extended version instead of the theatrical.  Anyway, ok movie, good cast with a lot of recognizable faces, but didn’t really hit the right notes for me.",

      "Away from horror (and horror docs) for now and going over to westerns.  I’ve watched a lot of the westerns I own, but I always stumble on new ones while out shopping.  This one comes in a double pack that I found used at Vintage Stock for pretty cheap.  It’s a pretty by-the-books western.  Fun fact, it’s got Cameron Mitchell, aka Santa from <strong>Space Mutiny (1988)</strong>.  The movie starts out focused on the bandits and gathering up their crew a bit, which is kind of different.  But then it switches focus on this town and a sheriff who wants to protect the town from the bandits.  Then there’s a shop-owner (Santa) who doesn’t want to get involved.  All the while.. there is a local legend about a Jim Hart (I’m assuming the spelling here), who is like a masked crusader.  So it’s basically a superhero type movie but a western.  You’ll never guess who the masked man is… anyway, it’s an ok movie, this blu-ray transfer was definitely not great quality (a lot of pops and tears and all that).  It’s fine for a standard 60s western but not anything real memorable.",

      "It’s a good question.  I had never heard the name before buying the Arrow set.. but little did I know, I had seen two of his movies:  <strong>The Giant Spider Invasion (1975)</strong> and <strong>Blood Harvest (1987)</strong>.  The first thanks to MST3K and the second thanks to the Last Drive-In.  Then, just this past Halloween, I watched one from the set: <strong>The Demons of Ludlow (1983)</strong>.  I thought that one wasn’t too bad, but not really “good”.. just a fun little small town horror movie.  So anyway, now I know who Bill Rebane is.  He is another of these low budget horror filmmakers who was most active in and around the 70s, similar to those like Al Adamson, HG Lewis, and William Grefé.  The distinct thing about him is he is a Wisconsinite so his movies are made in a more midwestern location and style.  The documentary itself is fine, just another of those movie-by-movie account of his career, just like the Grefé one.  However, maybe it was intentional, but this one just felt a little.. off.  I think they wanted to try to give this “weird” vibe to it, so there was a lot of silence and not much “flash” to the documentary.  Still informative, but just felt a little more lifeless than the other ones.  I’ll be curious to check out the rest of his movies someday, probably in some other watchlists.. but at least I have a little context now going into them.",

      'A 4.5 hour documentary specifically about 80s horror.  You know that’s right up my alley.  I’m a big fan of these kinds of documentaries..<strong>Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy (2010)</strong> and <strong>Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete history of Friday the 13th (2013)</strong> are ones I could watch any time and one of my all-time favorite things is the Horror Movie Podcast’s 4-episode 80s slasher fest.  Movies that are just people talking about various movies for a few minutes each is fun for me.  These documentaries won’t change the world or anything, but for what they are, they are super interesting.  One thing that was particularly fun about this movie was seeing movies pop up that I had only seen due to these watchlists or The Last Drive-In.  According to this <a href="https://letterboxd.com/thedezz/list/in-search-of-darkness-part-ii/decade/1980s/">list</a>, filtered by 80s movies only, I’ve currently seen 134 out of 173 (77%) of them.  Not bad!  Hopefully, I’ll keep making progress on that list as I go (mostly depends on whether some of these movies get released on these boutique labels in the US though..).  Anyway, all in all, I find myself kind of glued to these kinds of documentaries.  I could have watched another four hours (but not in one sitting..I didn’t do this one in a single sitting anyway)',

      "This is a movie that came with the William Grefé Arrow set.  Of course it’s a documentary about his movies, how he got into movies, all that kind of stuff.  He seems like a chill dude.  He was a Florida Man and used that as the setting of a lot of these movies.  Now, so far, I’ve only seen one of his movies, <strong>Mako: The Jaws of Death (1976)</strong> and it was not as bad as I expected given how low budget is clearly was.  Based on the clips and overviews they did on some of his other movies… I don’t know that they are really my style, but I guess when you take them in their context, they should be fun.  This documentary didn’t really have anything really “important” to it, just kind of a bunch of behind-the-scenes type stories and some clips.  But still, it’s informative and interesting to me to learn about a directory who I’m not very familiar with.",

There is some loose narration by Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen with some overreacting movie theater crowd.  Anyway, I wasn’t sure what to expect and it’s a little hard to explain the format.  It just goes back and forth with various movie clips, but with no info on what they are (most of the time, I’d recognize them, but sometimes I’d have no idea what movie it is).  Meanwhile, the narration is talking about certain concepts or ideas, but not in a very clear or in-depth way.  Anyway, it’s ok for what it is, but it doesn’t really provide anything new, like some extra information or little known facts.  But I guess you can still call it a horror doc, at least.",

      "Here it is… the big one.  This was the final boss of Sci-Fi Cheese.  Although it’s a different brand of sci-fi.. more of a <strong>Mad Max</strong> on the water style of movie.  No spaceships, no lasers, nothing like that.  But it does have some cheese, although not quite as much as I expected.  The reason I called this the big one is because it’s kind of infamous for being a big budget but bad movie.  It actually isn’t too bad but, to be fair, I watched the “Ulysses” cut, so I have no idea how that differs from the original cut.  What I liked about is just the general premise.  Like, yeah.. what IF the world was pretty much all ocean?  With climate change, who knows.. anyway, it has that post-apocalyptic aspect to it of people grouping together (good or bad groups) and forming miniature civilizations.  There’s a lot of potential there and this movie did some cool things with it, like the trader aspect and the underwater scenes especially.  Where it get goes a little off the rails is just that general 90s action movie cheese.  Cartoonish villains (but still, it’s Dennis Hopper so it’s entertaining) and just some general goofy characters sometimes.  A re-imagining of this world that’s a bit more brutal and “realistic” could actually work pretty well.  As it is though, this is just an all right movie but it’s looong.",

      "Back to the purest of pure Sci-Fi Cheese.  This movie is also pure 80s, from the early scenes in the trailer park to the visual effects.  It’s pretty simple.. a guy in a trailer park is really good at some arcade game, which ends up being some kind of recruiting device to find starfighters to fight in some space war.  He gets recruited and eventually reluctantly accepts the job and so on.  There’s a book from a few years back called <strong>Armada</strong> that pretty much copied this formula, so this movie felt kind of familiar to me.  The movie has two actors from 80s movies that I really like: Catherine Mary Stewart from <strong>Night of the Comet (1984)</strong> and Lance Guest from <strong>Halloween II (1981)</strong>.  So that’s already a plus… and I enjoyed the first part of the movie.. it has that cozy 80s feel to it.  Once it gets to space, it gets a little worse.. the effects are very early CGI and pretty ugly.  The space part isn’t quite as epic as some of the other movies earlier in this week.  I still liked the charm of it all, I just wish it had a bit more of the epic adventure aspect to it in the later half.",

      "With a name like “Krull”, you know it’s gonna be good.  Well it’s not really.. it definitely has the cheese aspect.  As far as the sci-fi part.. it’s really more fantasy with a little bit of sci-fi sprinkled in (some pew pew laser guns, for example).  But sci-fi and fantasy are basically cousins so, why not group this movie in the Sci-Fi Cheese category.  The movie is fun in a way.. it’s really just a fantasy quest where the protagonist meets various sorts of different groups or creatures and they all team up for a fight.  So it’s actually fairly similar to <strong>Battle Beyond the Stars (1980)</strong> in that way, which I like.  But the effects and the general “feel” of the movie are a little.. eh.  Nothing really laughably bad, but just some generic fantasy that doesn’t feel like anything too unique.  What was notable though.. Liam Neeson.  This is definitely the earliest movie of his I’ve seen.. who knew in 10 years he’d be playing Oskar Schindler.. Anyway, fun structure but a little underwhelming in the experience, but I wouldn’t be opposed to watching it again sometime.",

      "This might be the pinnacle of cheesy sci-fi.  The look and style of the movie is imaginative but.. goofy.  A lot of spandex, robes and shiny things.  But at least it has a very distinct vibe to it that is hard to find anywhere else, so it’s got that.  Although it is pretty fun to look at and it’s a big adventure, I didn’t find it as entertaining as I’d hoped.  The premise is “simple”.. some Earthlings (a football player – Flash Gordon, a love interest and a crazy scientist) end up in some alien civilization and this ruler, Ming, is going to destroy Earth.  But Flash Gordon says no way, Ming.  Then it’s just a space adventure from there with a lot of near-death situations.  What’s interesting about this movie is that they have actors like Max von Sydow and Timothy Dalton and, of course, the theme song by Queen (aaAAAhh).  It’s a strange cheesy movie to get that level of talent involved.  My guess is they wanted that <strong>Star Wars</strong> money.  So overall, it’s kind of a spectacle and mostly fun, despite being a giant ball of cheese.  It’s hard to dislike the movie.",

So of course this is heavily inspired by that.  The effects are definitely cheesy.. some of the costumes are kind of funny, too (one alien race has a painted-on eye on their forehead.. not sure if that’s supposed to be real..?).  But overall, it’s not <em>as</em> bad as I expected.  It’s actually pretty fun.  A non-violent world is contacted by a leader of another group saying he wants to colonize them…or ELSE!  And he shows off his advanced weaponry just to prove his point.  So this non-violent group of people have to go find mercenaries to fight for them.  That’s pretty much what the whole movie is.. one representative from this group going from place to place to enlist help to fight the big bad guy.  Then there is the big battle at the end.

This is kind of overly serious for what it is and somehow manages to make Nazi zombies a little boring to me.  The movie is about some captured Russian soldiers being introduced to some Nazi experiment zombies and then the Russians trying to fight their way out of this facility.  Acting-wise.. it’s ok.  The Nazi leader actor seems like he’s having fun though.  My kind of zombie movie is more of the widespread zombie apocalypse and the focus on society and survival.  This one is not my kind of zombie movie, unfortunately.  I can’t say it was bad.. I expected worse, honestly, just based on the blu-ray cover.  But ultimately, this movie didn’t inspire me to want to go back and watch the first two in this series.  It’s a pretty forgettable zombie action movie.",

      "With this, I’ve <em>almost</em> scene all the Hatchet movies, except for <strong>Hatchet II (2010)</strong>.  I first saw <strong>Hatchet (2006)</strong> when I randomly saw it streaming somewhere a few years ago.. maybe it was Hulu?  Anyway, I had heard a lot about it as being a throwback to 80s slashers and it basically was but it seemed like it was trying a little too hard and the humor just wasn’t hitting for me.  Then just within the past year, I saw <strong>Victor Crowley (2017)</strong> on the Last Drive-In and it’s fun enough but, again, it’s just a bit goofy for me.  So onto this one and yeah, it’s more of the same.  What I do like about it is that there are a lot of horror actors and actresses.. Zach Galligan, Caroline Williams, Kane Hodder, Derek Mears, and, of course, Danielle Harris.  Plus a cameo as a racist shut-in by Sid Haig.  I remember catching just a bit of this on TV, I think in a hotel in Phoenix years back, but not enough to know what was really going on.  The main character from previous movies thought she killed Victor Crowley, went to the police station bloody with a gun and a scalp and, surprisingly, they think she might have killed someone.  So she is jailed, a journalist teams up with her and a deputy to try to do some kind of “mythical” solution to the Victor Crowley problem while others are getting killed by VC.  It’s ok as a slasher, but the patented “Hatchet Humor” just doesn’t quite do it for me.  The kill effects sometimes just seem a little too cheap and over-the-top.  But it’s fun enough for something nobody should take too seriously.  I’d come in at like a 5.5 but I’ll give it just a bit of a bump due to the obvious love of horror behind it.",

      "Well.. this movie.  I’ll say right off the bat, I’m torn on this one.. between a 4 and a 4.5.  I gave <strong>Chernobyl Diaries (2012)</strong> a 4.5 and I feel this is fairly similar.. but maybe worse?  We’ll see what I talk myself into as I go through the process of writing this post.  As a “Random Sequel”, it’s kind of an interesting one because I’ve seen the OG <strong>Fright Night (1985)</strong>, which I liked.. but I never saw its sequel or the 2011 remake.  But I do at least recognize the names of some of the major characters here.. Charlie Brewster, Evil Ed and Peter Vincent.  This one takes place in Romania, some kind of study abroad type of thing and they meet a female vampire and vampirey stuff happens from that point forward.  That all seems fine enough, so why don’t I like the movie?  Ugh the characters.. Charlie is sort of boring and a little whiny.  Ed is the worst.. trying way too hard to be funny and it’s not working.  Peter Vincent is <em>ok</em> but just too cheesy in the end.  It’s just one of those movies where I feel a little embarrassed watching it when I see these characters interact.  Outside of that, it’s not a super interesting or original movie.  Lila from Dexter is the main vampire villain and she’s not too bad, basically just a female version of the seducer type vampire from the original 1985 version (and presumably 2011 remake).  So I’ll be a little more generous here and go with the 4.5 but I’m putting Fright Night 2 on notice: you were <em>this</em> close to a 4.",

      "Another random sequel, but this time, I’ve at least seen one of them, which is the original: <strong>Resident Evil (2002)</strong>.  That one isn’t really my thing.. a lot of over-the-top action and not a lot of the creepiness and survival aspect from the original games.  This is even more over-the-top.  One of the cheesiest villains I’ve ever seen and a loooot of slow motion action scenes.  The action scenes are decently well-shot and choreographed, I guess, but most other things in the movie seem to be too… SyFy.   Characters are either too cool, too annoying, too bland or too weak without much in between.  Instead of going the “too cool” route, I think it could have been more enjoyable if they took themselves less seriously.  So it’s about what I’d expect the fourth movie in this series to be, but it still isn’t for me… but I can’t deny that it’s at least <em>ok</em> in some technical aspects.",

      "The first of the random sequels.  I have no familiarity at all with this series, but since it was released as a Scream Factory Collector’s Edition, of course I had to get it.  So I just jumped right in at part three and.. it’s not too good.  I don’t think that this comes from me not having any context.. it’s just a typical cheap action movie with some clumsy martial arts.  A very 80s aerobics instructor and telephone repairwoman, I guess?, gets possessed by some ninja and begins to kill and there is some other ninja guy after this special sword.  Anyway, the story doesn’t <em>really</em> matter.. it’s that the fights aren’t very impressive, the overall movie is pretty cheesy and it’s not super interesting.  There is a lot of very 80s stuff in there though, which kind of adds that sentimental 80s feeling, but otherwise, it’s not very notable for me.  I give it a little credit because it feels like they at least made some effort, it’s just very amateurish.",

This is a movie structured similarly to a lot of the other movies I just watched in this category: killer on the loose, a cop is obsessively determined to catch the killer, he gets teamed up with a partner, they have to save the girl, etc.  It just happens to take place in a dystopian-ish London.  It definitely has the crime and the action, but it goes for comedy a lot, kind of a buddy cop movie.. but that part doesn’t work so well to me.  Rutger Hauer is generally cool but it’s a little overdone in the movie.  It’s a pretty typical early 90s action movie, but it does get a little out there at the end.  Not a terrible movie but it didn’t really hit me like I hoped.  Also, shout out to the weapon provider guy.. a wise old philosopher from <strong>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989)</strong>..

      "It’s Bronson time again and, surprise, the return of 80s slashers.  Well, for this movie anyway.  Yeah this is technically an 80s slasher, but with Charles Bronson it also has that police action movie feel, so I decided to throw it into this category.  It really does fit in with a movie like <strong>Don’t Answer the Phone (1980)</strong> where the focus is on the killer and the cop trying to catch him.  Also, this one is in LA too (now the obligatory comparison to <strong>Vice Squad (1982)</strong> and <strong>Angel (1984)</strong>..), but this time it was less obvious.  I had to Google that to verify since it doesn’t show off the city as much as those other movies.  Anyway, the movie is really simple in its premise.. a guy is going around killing women, Charles Bronson is a cop and he and his partner are after this guy.  There’s some complications with fabricating evidence and blah blah, but basically it’s Bronson vs this crazy guy.  What more could you want?  I thought it was pretty decent even if it is a little too typical “rogue cop” sometimes, which doesn’t feel too original.  The main characters are likeable, the killer is pretty creepy so it mostly works.",

      "This might be the crimiest and actioniest one so far.  It’s another of those movies that shows the seedier side of LA (like <strong>Don’t Answer the Phone (1980)</strong> and, as I mentioned in that post, <strong>Angel (1984)</strong> as well).  It could be fun to do a little marathon sometime with those three as grimey 70s/80s LA and the something like <strong>Taxi Driver (1976)</strong>, <strong>Maniac (1980)</strong>, and <strong>Cruising (1980)</strong> as the NYC version of that.  Anyway, enough of the movie name dropping.  This movie is fairly straightforward in its premise.. there’s a bad dude (played by Wings Hauser, one of the best names in the biz) who ends up beating a prostitute to death.  The cops and a prostitute friend of hers team up to try to bring this guy down.. they get him, he escapes, he’s after her and they are trying to get to him or her before he kills her.  Got it?  Anyway, it’s fun, maybe a bit stereotypical in some ways on the different characters portrayed, but the bad dude is pretty bad and you want to see him caught so it’s easy to root for the good guys.  There’s also a random kind of side scene involving a wedding/funeral setup which was surprisingly disturbing.  Overall, a pretty good movie that I’d never heard of until Scream Factory released it.",

      "This one is not so much “Crime &amp; Action” as I thought it might be.  It does start out with a crime and the rest of the movie is kind of based around the impact of that crime, but the rest of the movie is more of a suspense film.  The movie starts in 1959 where a man loses his wife and daughter in a botched kidnapping rescue.  The rest of the movie has a bit of <strong>Vertigo (1958)</strong> to it with some other twists and turns.  The reason I was interested in this one in the first place was just because it’s an earlier Brian De Palma movie.  His movies feel a bit like giallo movies turned American and, coincidentally, this does take place a bit in Italy.  But it doesn’t feel too much like a giallo otherwise, which was a bit disappointing for me.  But it’s still a very interesting movie, even if it didn’t quite match the category as well as the other movies have.  Also, you can’t go wrong with John Lithgow, so it’s got that in it’s favor, too.",

The main character is a professor who apparently has a past as a kind of hitman or something?  Anyway, he is pulled back in for a job that will require him to climb part of some mountain.. the Eiger, as it were.  So a good chunk of the movie is him training and preparing for this climb and the actual climb itself.  Now, I have to confess, I am not a mountain climber.  So after a little bit of this, I started to lose interest, even if some of it was pretty interesting or tense.

So I guess this is really my first venture into the Bronson action world and it’s pretty fun.  In this one, he just really wants to harvest his watermelons and people are getting in the way of him doing that peacefully.  He’s arrested, ends up making enemies with a prisoner there and then he’s got this guy coming after him, which is not something you want.  Pretty straightforward but I think that’s all that’s needed here.  At one point, Bronson does the angry Arthur fist meme, pretty funny.

Sweet, I’ll get that.. if I see it on sale at the store”.. well, a couple years later and I finally did.  Probably saved about 4 dollars.. anyway, was it worth the wait?  Well, I liked it.  It was a bit different from what I expected.  The “friends” aspect had me expecting more of a gang movie, but instead it’s more like a loose connection of people that this guy knows that show up in various parts of the movie.  But that’s still good.  It’s a older criminal trying to stay out of prison so he can live a normal life with his family and so he’s working with a detective to try to get a “get out of jail free” card.  There are other scenes of bank robberies as well, which almost feel like a side story.  Individually, a lot of the scenes are really entertaining, but I just wish it was a little more.. connected.

Unfortunately for this movie, it came about 6-7 years after the big slasher boom.  Taken on its own, it’s ok.. just some not-so-memorable slasher.  Given the fact that it’s 1989, I have to judge it a little harsher because it’s a bit too unoriginal.  Like I said.. simple.  Just a boyfriend visiting his girlfriend’s family in a rural area and then killings happen.  Nothing special and it’s not TOO terribly made.. but some rough acting here and there and the kills aren’t impressive.

I don’t dislike them, it’s just that the musical aspect doesn’t really do anything for me.  This is similar, but I do appreciate the opera house setting and the actual “opera scenes” are fairly limited.  So this time it was actually a pro instead of a con.  Otherwise, it’s a typical mystery killer type of movie with the standard Argento style, some good colorful shots here and there and a bit of blood.

      "This movie is a slasher but it’s a little light on the slashing.  There’s a high schooler whose parents died when he was a baby, so he lives with his aunt.  This aunt is a little weird from the outset, but maybe not <em>quite</em> as weird as the aunt in <strong>Sleepaway Camp (1983)</strong>.  There is a killing and some cop who <em>really</em> wants the killer to be this main character.  The cop is also pretty homophobic.  There is another cop who I recognize from <strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)</strong> as the store owner.  Him being in this movie kind of makes me tie these two movies together.. they are of similar quality, they even have a main character named Billy.  The only thing is you don’t have the Christmas coziness here.  Anyway.. the movie is a bit slow if you’re looking for a straight-up slasher, but it still has entertainment value.  You get a bit of crazy aunt, a bit of good cop/bad cop and a bit of 80s high school movie so.. there you go.  Something for everyone.",

A bit too long, but it’s about what you’d expect from an earlier slasher.  Mystery around who the killer is, lots of potential killers, blah blah.  So in that sense, it’s what I expected.  But the characters aren’t too interesting and they are all kind of similar.. I kind of forgot who was who.  Not much else to say.. it’s interesting, decently made and a pretty straightforward slasher (after watching a more “meta” slasher and a serial killer movie), but it doesn’t stand out much to me among other slashers.",

      "“This guy are sick”.  But really, he is.  This is an interesting watch since I just happened to catch the movie <strong>Angel (1984)</strong> on the Last Drive-In a few weeks back and this has some similarities.  First, it’s about a real weird killer where you actually get to spend a little time with him, rather than him only appearing in the movie here and there for the kill scenes.  Second, it’s in LA and there is a bit of nighttime LA driving around (but not as much as <strong>Angel</strong>).  Finally, the detectives hunting the killer down is a bit similar as well.  Although in this movie, the cops are kind of the comedic relief.  Also, this killer is much more talkative but just as crazy.  It’s actually a pretty decent movie.. the comedic cops were sometimes a little more miss than hit, but the overall movie was actually surprisingly good for an 80s slasher.  And as far as it’s “80s slasher-ness”.. it’s more of a serial killer movie but there is a final girl and the standard detective(s) after the killer, so it’s basically a slasher but maybe not in it’s purest form.  Anyway, fun movie.",

      "Starting it off with one that kind of is and kind of isn’t a slasher.  At least, it doesn’t really have a lot of the tropes, but it does revolve around the making of a slasher-like movie so it still fits this category in my book.  Not knowing anything about this movie until popping it in today, I was surprised that it’s George Romero-adjacent.  Both Tom Savini and Joe Pilato are in it.. it’s basically made by friends of Romero.  Anyway, about the movie itself.. a guy is working on the movie and gets involved with a woman who is also working on the crew.  The guy starts noticing some weirdness with the director and other crew and so on and so on.  Am I weird for actually kind of liking this movie?  Maybe.. but it’s really not too bad.  Obviously not much budget, but it’s done decently well and the main character is actually likeable.  It’s fun but slow for most of it and then ramps up near the end.  I was pleasantly surprised since I went into it expecting just another run-of-the-mill slasher, but instead it’s actually something a little more unique.",

      "This is a fun one.. mostly.  It’s fun because it gathers up a few members of horror royalty: John Carradine, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and, of course the reason I watched it this week, Vincent Price.  So take these classic horror actors and put them on top of a typical 80s horror movie and you get this.  It’s pretty weird to see these guys in suits in one shot, then the younger group of characters in early 80s casualwear.  In the movie, a writer opts to go to some creepy mansion in Wales to knock out a writing project.  Once there, people start showing up one by one (kind of a reverse slasher?).  But then some do start to die one by one so there you go.  It all evens out.  The ending of the movie was a little cheap and cheesy and I was not really feeling this main character (played by Desi Arnaz Jr.. I Love Lucy + Ricky Ricardo).. his acting was a little suspect.  So really this is a kind of forgettable 80s horror movie made memorably by its classic horror cast.  Still not great, but at least worth a watch for that reason alone.",

      "Here’s a little bit of a different style of VP movie.  I watched <strong>The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971)</strong> several years ago and my memory of it is pretty fuzzy.  In fact, I was wondering if I for sure watched that one and not the sequel, but after watching the sequel just now, I can say that it was totally unfamiliar to me, so I definitely watched the original back then.  Anyway, with all that preface out of the way, this movie was about what I expected.  A crazy guy with a weird voice box torturing and killing his victims.  This time he had a silent partner woman to eat with and who would play music for him, so that’s nice.  The movie has a lot to do with Egypt.. Egyptian mythology, settings, stuff like that.  It’s such a strange movie that it stays interesting.  Even the normal parts of the movie with the detectives is still pretty entertaining.  Their conversation with the club(?) owner was pretty funny.  I can’t compare it much to the first since it’s been too long, but I found this one pretty fun and I’d watch it again sometime when I’m in the mood for something a little weird.",

      "Another Vincent Price period piece.  It’s hard to think of movies of his where he isn’t in a historic period.  Anyway, this is the 1600s, I think, if the Letterboxd description is to be believed.  It has to do with witches again, so 1600s makes sense.  In this one, VP is a kind of evil ruler, a bit of a mix of his characters in <strong>The Masque of the Red Death (1964)</strong> and <strong>Witchfinder General (1968)</strong>.  This dude tortures some witch and he probably shouldn’t do that because that causes a whole lot of vengeance.  Again, a cool setup, but the movie just wasn’t too entertaining for me.  The horror is decent, but I think a lot of it is more implied.  If distant howling sounds freak you out, here you go.  It has a good atmosphere, at least.  Not bad but not as enjoyable for me as the previous VP movies this week.",

      "More Vincent Price and this one is a Roger Corman film.  It’s supposedly an Edgar Allen Poe adaptation, but according to Wikipedia, it’s in name only.  The actual story is from an H.P. Lovecraft story, so that’s cool.  I really enjoy the setup and the setting.. a warlock is burned by the townspeople in a New England town (Arkham of course) and vows revenge.  Fast-forward a century or so later and a descendant of the warlock, who looks exactly like him, comes to town and townspeople get a little antsy and the warlock gets a little possessy.  From there, it’s about what you’d expect.. the warlock possesses the descendant to get his revenge on the townspeople.  It’s a little strange, I guess the genes are very strong in this part of the country because all descendants look exactly like their ancestors..?  That was confusing to me.. but anyways, the town is a great part of the movie.  Always foggy and dark, perfect atmosphere for Halloween.  The movie loses a bit of steam towards the end.. it seems like a lot of these do, so maybe that’s just my problem, but it’s still a fun watch and one I may pick up again for the atmosphere.",

The only problem is that the ending seemed a bit slow compared to the first 2/3 of the movie.  But still good.. it had a bit of a Hammer feel to it (even a character named Paul).  VP adds a bit to this movie to make it better, otherwise, it’d be a little bit more of a run-of-the-mill 60s horror movie.  But in the end, I liked it..

This final one is a pretty straightforward murder mystery so it gets the job done.  The ending is pretty interesting and at least fun for that, but the movie is a little slow otherwise.  The main character is a woman who is mute due to some traumatic past experience and then people around her start dying.  Finally at the end, there is the big reveal where someone explains everything from the movie.  Kind of a funny trope that’s still used a lot to end mysteries, even with shows like Psych and Monk.  Not sure if that ever happens in real life though.  So anyway, good enough movie but I kind of wish it was a little more “horror” in those middle parts of the movie.",

The story is basically of a missing/murdered little girl as well as various victims who get killed here and there.  The main character, the detective, is played by George Hilton who the blog remembers as the random Sartana that wasn’t played by Gianni Garko.

This last movie was fairly giallo-like, making it a perfect movie to transition into next week.  In that way, it’s a decent watch.  But there are some things about it that were kind of.. strange or distressing.  First, the pig bloodletting scene.. bleh.  That’s no good.  Second, the music is strange and that’s not the first time in these Naschy movies that the music is kind of oddly unfitting.  This time, the recurring music cycled between something that sounds kind of like the Bewitched TV theme and another song that’s a weird variant on the “Are You Sleeping?” nursery rhyme song.  And other times, some kind of upbeat jazzy music in moments that are supposed to be more suspenseful or tense.  So yeah, this movie could have really benefitted from some moodier music, but I guess it’s the 70s.  Not quite the tone I’d like but it still has some of that giallo coziness I’ve grown fond of.",

      "This guy sure was busy in 1973.  Of the first three movies, I was probably most excited about this one as a zombie guy.  But I have to say, it’s a bit of a letdown.  These are closer to the voodoo zombies than the flesh-eating zombies and the movie is more about the rituals and those who control the zombies rather than the zombies themselves.  So that’s a letdown for me.. again, there is also the kind of “giallo-y” investigation going on outside of all this zombie stuff.  And again, Paul Naschy plays multiple characters.  I’m not sure why that’s necessary but anyway.  The movie is a little messy and I’m pretty sure they killed a live chicken, which is a little..eh.. so overall, I hoped for something more than what the movie actually was.  Oh and also the soundtrack sometimes was very peppy for something called “Vengeance of the Zombies”",

      "So what are these antagonists anyway?  They kind of look and act like vampires, but they don’t bite and they raise the dead and create zombies?  Letterboxd says they are warlocks so that’s good enough for me, I guess.  In this one, Paul Naschy plays several characters, differentiated by facial hair and hairstyle.  The movie starts in medieval France with the execution of these warlocks.  I was kind of excited that this might be a purely historical setting but unfortunately, it zips to present day (well present day 1970s anyway) right after.  Then there is a sort of séance and those never seem to end well.  Yada yada yada, warlocks are back and killing/controlling people.  It kind of slowed down for me at that point, but later on there are some zombies so I started to get excited again.  But that zombie thing was fairly short-lived.  In the end, it had some cool ideas but the end result didn’t quite reach the potential for me.",

      "A new week and the first movie of October.  This week is Paul Naschy movies, courtesy of the two Scream Factory collections.  I’m not very familiar with his works so this will be a bit of a mystery week for me.  This first one is a take on the mad doctor and sympathetic “monster”.. ok, he isn’t a monster really, just deformed.  Though in this movie, the hunchback is the main character.  There is also a murder investigation going on in the background which has that giallo feel to it.  It feels pretty familiar though, with all of those Universal movies where the “monster” loves a woman.  So it’s an ok intro to the week, but I’m hoping things get a little wilder as we go..",

      "Finally to 1989, the end of the decade and what’s the grand finale?  A Brad Pitt slasher.  Yeah, I was curious about this one due to that fact, so I had to pick it from my 1989 options.  There is even a bit of Martin Mull sprinkled in.  Anyway, this is a slasher in a high school setting, which is kind of a traditional setting, but so far this week I’ve had slashers in woods, hospitals, dance studios.. so it’s a nice change of pace.  Besides its setting, it’s still pretty traditional.. people getting killed one-by-one, a mystery as to who the killer is, some twists back and forth.  The main characters make it a little more interesting.. Brad Pitt isn’t quite Brad Pitt yet but he still stands out compared to typical slasher characters.  One thing to note is that everyone in this school is a pervert.. it’s a little creepy.  At the end of the day, it’s a safe and reliable slasher that’s a bit above average for me.",

      "Where to begin on this one.. well, I’ll start by saying it’s a lot like <strong>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)</strong>, even starring Jennifer Rubin, who was Taryn in that movie.  She is an ex-cult member who survived some kind of mass suicide by fire or something.  She ends up in a hospital with other patients of varying mental disorders with several group therapy sessions as people from that group get picked off here and there.. so really similar in that respect.  It’s very psychological, a lot of hallucinations and things like that.  The kills always appear to be in the form of suicide but.. are they..?  Anyway, that part is not so interesting.  There are two notable things about the movie for me.. one is the cast.  I recognized a lot of people, Dr Dan Cain from <strong>Re-Animator (1985)</strong>, a guy from <strong>Werewolf (1996)</strong> (or were-wilf?), mobster Jerome Belasco from an episode of Frasier and finally.. Tommy Pickles herself.  The other notable thing was the music.. I never thought I’d hear Sweet Child O’ Mine in a random 80s slasher but.. here we are.  So it was definitely an interesting experience with a lot of little notable things here and there, but as an 80s slasher?  Eh.. it’s not very traditional, too psychological and a little too boring, but for those who like a “slasher in a hospital”, this is that at least.",

      "The thing that stood out about this movie and made me choose it over other the handful of other 1987 slashers I had available to me was the cover art.  It’s of course a take on the painting American Gothic.. and just by this cover, you can kind of tell the movie is going to be a crazy killer family and.. yep, that’s what it is.  The fun thing about this is that it’s on an island, so the isolation aspect plays into it.  I kind of expected more of a rural farmhouse type of setup, but this is fine too.  Plot-wise, it’s not too unique.. a group of friends have to make an emergency landing in their sea plane on some island and stumble into this crazy family and you know where it goes from there.  The group of friends are just as uninteresting as most slashers.. the killer family is fairly disturbing.  The movie feels like a long lost descendant of movies like <strong>Motel Hell (1980)</strong>.  Anyway, it’s a little creepy but the slasher aspects are not too memorable, except I’ve never seen death-by-swing.  The ending dragged on quite a while though.. but all in all, a decent slasher.",

Imagine him creeping on people through a crawlspace (and sometimes on a kind of hilarious rolling device) and there you go.  Oh and he’s a Nazi too.  That’s pretty much it.  The kill scenes themselves are not too memorable, but there are some creepy and disturbing scenes of the bodies afterwards, in the standard slasher “tour of the dead” thing.  One in particular with a piano stood out.  Among the sea of slashers, it’s not very memorable outside of Klaus Kinski, but it’s kind of fun.. especially if you’re in the mood for a more contained setting.. I think this is almost entirely in this apartment building?  Either way, kind of fun but not overly memorable.",

      "An 80s slashers + zombies?  Ooooo.. and it takes place on Halloween?  Heart eyes emoji.  Yep, this one is almost tailor-made for me.  It’s a bit like <strong>The Midnight Hour (1985)</strong> for me, but with the added slasher angle.. huh, both 1985, good year eh?  The execution of it is only ok, the kills were not great and there is a <em>lot</em> of annoying screaming and yelling.  But still, the premise, the cemetery setting, the general “spooky” vibe and the distinctly 80s music is enough for me.  Also, one kid has a sweet Michael Jackson jacket (not the classic red one, but a jacket with a drawing of MJ on the back).  The plot is the typical group of teens mistakenly raise the dead and, at first, it’s just one and that’s the one doing the slashing.  Then in the final part of the movie, it’s multiple corpses and that’s even better for me.  It’s zombie chaos at that point.  Maybe the production quality is not super high, but this is classic Halloween season fun and I just lucked out by picking it as one of the 80s slashers for this watchlist.  Destiny again!",

      "This title sounds like it could be any horror movie but it’s a, you guessed it, slasher in the woods.  This one has a couple recognizable actors, like ol Joey Pants and Bob Cobb.. er, the Maestro.. from Seinfeld.  You’ve got an unstable bus driver that’s in charge of taking a group of people out to this wilderness.. there’s some internal conflict, people start dying and it’s a slasher.  This one has a bit more of that wilderness survival aspect to it rather than more of a fun camp vibe like many woods slashers.  So there isn’t a whole lot else to say about the movie, but it’s decently fun.  The group of characters is a little bit more interesting than some of the previous movies this week, at least.

So for 1980, this is a movie about a guy who <em>really</em> likes movies and snaps and you can guess what happens next.  I first heard about this movie in an 80s horror trailer compilation and I found it pretty interesting.  Then, a couple years later, here we are with a Vinegar Syndrome release.  Destiny.  It’s less “slasher-y” than many other movies.  For one, the killer is the protagonist, which is usually not the case.  Two, he uses a gun at one point but.. in the context, I’m gonna allow it.  But still you get him killing victims one-by-one.  Anyway, this movie is pretty fun for weirdos like me.  There is a ton of movie trivia and references, from posters to clips to quotes.  It’s maybe a little too much at times, but still fun.  Dennis Cristopher plays the main character pretty well, just crazy enough to make this plot seem semi-believable.

It has a little bit of that <strong>Midsommar (2019)</strong> feel, though with less technical quality and without the interesting visuals.

The movie does feel a bit like a Larry Fessenden movie but it didn’t quite hit me in the same way.  It’s a kind of simple but sort of ridiculous premise where a pretentious TV chef freaks out on an overly harsh critic and it becomes a kidnapping/torture kind of movie.  And that’s basically the movie.  I wavered between “is this bad..” or “do I like it..” and I think I settled on “I kind of liked it”.  It’s not a masterpiece, obviously, but I guess the fact that there are established actors is enough to elevate the quality.

      "Another day, another Horror Pack movie.  If I was titling this movie, it’d be “There Was an Attempt: The Movie”.. “There Was an Attempt” in that.. hey they tried but the end result was.. not good.  This had the feel of <strong>Harvest of Fear (2004)</strong> and <strong>A Brush with Death (2007)</strong>, but with <em>slightly</em> more polish.  I guess if you add 10+ years of technology on those two movies, you get this.  This is basically a revenge film with three women (and one guy friend) go to a house for revenge against some abusers.  It gets a bit psychological towards the end but I was pretty disinterested by that time.  The acting ranges from bad to over-the-top in some cases.  Oh and the action/violence scenes are super awkward.  Like, they are pretending to be very vicious but you can tell the actors are really trying not to hurt each other.  Good for them.. nobody should actually get hurt for the sake of a movie like this.. maybe that’s too harsh.  Anyway, my first Horror Pack experience was surprisingly not too bad, but this second experience was kind of what I expected these Horror Pack movies to be.",

      "Horror pack week starts right…. now.  The first one, I don’t even know what to call it.  The  cover of the copy I have is “Killer Party” but Letterboxd has it officially as “The Shower” so.. I guess we’ll go with that.  Either title fits.  It’s a baby shower that’s happening as some kind of rage virus stuff is going down.  So of course, people outside the party house attack some people in/near the house and then you get a fight inside and outside the house.  It’s pretty basic but it’s not bad.  The characters are all not really likeable or interesting.  I guess the angle here is that they are all LA stereotypes?  Unsuccessful actors/actresses/writers or agents, things like that.  So maybe this movie is more fun if you know those kinds of people, but I don’t.  I’m just a simple man.  Anyway, despite not finding the characters too endearing, it’s still a little bit fun but doesn’t really do anything new or memorable.  I think they really try to make the clown character a centerpiece, which seems kind of weird.  Anyway, a “not as bad as I thought” start to Horror Pack week.",

      "The final Universal movie for this watchlist.. it’s a little similar to <strong>Tower of London (1939)</strong> in that it’s more of a historical horror, nothing supernatural and no sci-fi horror.  For me, it’s pretty slow.. maybe I got used to some of those 60 minute Universal movies, but this one felt really long.  It’s a mix of an evil castle owner wanting revenge and a kind of star-crossed Romeo and Juliet love story thing.  And there is a panther hunt in there somewhere.  It has Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr, but Lon Chaney is barely used as some oaf.. Other than that, there isn’t much notable about the movie.  It’s not really what I look for when I want to sit down and watch a Universal horror movie, but that doesn’t make it a <em>bad</em> movie.. just not up my alley so much.",

Edit a lot of that down and add a bit more horror and it’s higher in my book</li><li><strong>The Monster and the Girl</strong> – Pretty disappointing for a movie with a gorilla on the cover.  More crime drama than anything, even though the gorilla is eventually there..</li>",
      "Well, none of these were exactly classics, but hey, it’s been a fun ride.  They are the right kind of movie to ease me into the Halloween season.  Still waiting on the weather to cool down though.. it’s not feeling like we’re nearing Halloween season outside, dammit.  I just want a crisp, cool Halloween season with some Count Chocula.. it’s the simple things in life.",

No gorillas in sight.  In a movie that’s only about an hour, at least the first half or more was just this drama.  Finally, a human brain is implanted into a gorilla body and then it gets a bit more interesting..but not much.  The gorilla scenes are still kind of slow and not as cheesy as I would have hoped.  In the end, I just didn’t get what I expected.  This is one of those most “meh” movies so far..",

Whaaat.. well, it’s not that unheard of, I believe <strong>Phantom of the Opera (1943)</strong> was also in color.. and this, coming just a year later, seems like a kind of spiritual successor so maybe that’s what they were going for.  This is similarly about an opera and similarly has way too many operatic scenes for me.  I’m going to be honest.. not really my thing.  While I did appreciate the look of the film and Boris Karloff playing the jealous crazy old guy, the movie was just too filled with all this opera-related stuff that doesn’t interest me.  Aside from that, I at least recognize another actor, Turhan Bey, who I feel looks like a 12-year-old with a drawn on mustache.  Turhan Beybyface.  Anyway, I obviously don’t have much relevant stuff to say about this movie so I’ll stop now.  It’s not a bad movie, it’s just not the kind of old horror movie I’m looking for.",

A group of guys make up a treasure hunting business and travel out to an island, bringing a woman and her.. friend?  The island has a big castle type place and people on the treasure hunting trip are dying one by one.  It’s mostly fun.. isolated mansion/castle on an island with a killer.  There are some typical old cheesy/cartoonish moments that you might expect from movies as old as this.  Again, it’s only 60 minutes, so it’s a quick watch.

      "It’s Universal time once again as we get into Week 3.  This first one is about what you’d expect from the title: a nice dude with some weird electrical immunity is experimented on and eventually turns into a, you guessed it, Man Made Monster.  The guy (Dynamo Dan, the Electric Man, as he’s known) is played by Lon Chaney Jr.  He is good as the sympathetic monsters, just like in <strong>The Wolf Man (1941)</strong>.  I actually assumed that he was cast in this role due to him playing the sympathetic Wolf Man but, actually, this came out a few months before The Wolf Man.  Anyway, it’s a standard Universal monster movie.. monster, mad scientist, damsel in distress.  Also, it’s only 60 minutes.  I do appreciate that these movies are nice and compact.  I also like the fact that, at one point in this movie, their plan was to execute this electric man by electrical chair.. hmm.  I wonder how that worked out for them.

      "The final exploitation movie is another one by a filmmaker I wouldn’t know if it wasn’t for Arrow putting out a set of his movies.  This time it’s Bill Rebane and, honestly, I’m not sure how much of an exploitation filmmaker he is.  I actually know nothing about him, but just kind of assumed he was more in that low-budget/exploitation area.  This movie didn’t feel too exploitative.. just a cheap, cheesy 80s horror movie.  It’s really similar to <strong>The Fog (1980)</strong> and it has a bit of that small-town element I like.  The effects are, like I said, cheesy.. things floating on strings and some unimpressive visual effects at the very end.  But it’s part of the charm.. the movie takes itself very seriously, so the cheesy parts come off as more of an “aw, at least they tried” thing.  In the movie, there is a town that has some cursed history, a couple people who are researching the town and other people who are getting killed.  Very <strong>Fog</strong>-like, as I mentioned.  I do think there was potential here and it was <em>almost</em> creepy near the end, so I give it some credit.  It hit some areas for me that are very subjective.. I guess to most other people, this movie wouldn’t get that same extra credit.  Even with that credit, it’s still only “OK” for me, but something I might watch again some day when the mood strikes.",

They don’t have the same kind of luxuries the big filmmakers have, so getting a competent movie made at all is still impressive.  So hats off to you, fellas.",

      "Jesús Franco, or Jess Franco, has made dozens of horror movies and, surprisingly, I had not seen a single one.  But now I have, as I stumbled into this when I started collecting 80s slashers put out by boutique labels.  Knowing his reputation as an exploitation filmmaker, I decided to put this movie in the “Exploitation” week.. I have plenty of others for the “80s Slashers” week.  So I’ll just think of this as a preview of what’s to come in a couple weeks.. anyway, the movie.  Well, it’s an early 80s slasher.  I guess in a time where 80s slashers were getting super popular, everyone tried to cash in.  It’s the typical structure, although in Spain rather than the US.  There’s a final girl along with her other girlfriends, who keep getting killed.  There is the “obvious” killer from the beginning, but is he?  The effects are not great, though there are a couple memorable kill scenes.  Outside of that, it doesn’t really do anything well or notable.  Adding the English dubbing to it just makes it even more awkward and unnatural.  As an 80s slasher, it’s got a little charm but pretty low quality, so it’s probably a bit below average.",

      "Hmm.. a shark movie released one year after <strong>Jaws (1975)</strong>, with the word “Jaws” in the title.. definitely makes you suspicious.  Well, according to the filmmaker himself, William Grefé, he claims he already had his story but couldn’t get any studios on board, then after <strong>Jaws</strong> came out, he was able to get a deal much more easily.  So I don’t know that the filmmaker himself was actively trying to exploit the success of <strong>Jaws</strong>, but for sure the studio wanted to capitalize.  Anyway.. given its low budget and technical limitations, it’s not <em>too</em> bad.. but it doesn’t live up to the title at all.  You’d expect a single killer shark terrorizing a beach or resort, just like <strong>Ja</strong>– well, you know.  Instead, it’s really more of a shark conservation movie with a guy who <em>really</em> likes sharks.  Seems noble at first, but things go a little too crazy by the end and that’s where the horror comes in.  Other than the ending, it really doesn’t have much horror to it.  So it ends up being a bit boring and definitely not what people are looking for when they see “Jaws of Death” in the title..",

It’s a sickness, I know.  Taking an early horror movie from this collection, I knew it might be a little bumpy.  This is horror in the sense that it’s kind of weird and out there and has a creepy/disturbing quality to it.  But the majority of the movie is either sexploitation or people talking, and it’s almost never a group of people talking.. it’s always 1-on-1 conversations.  I guess that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it just seemed like every couple minutes we’re jumping to another convo.  It’s not as bad as I expected it might be, but it is definitely very low budget and has some technical issues here and there because of that.

      "It’s Gruesome Twosome Tuesday!  And I’m back from vacation, ready to get back to it with some exploitation horror this week.  First filmmaker on the list is Herschell Gordon Lewis.  I watched a few of his movies back in the March Madness watchlist and I can tell they aren’t really my style.  The gore stuff is fun and a weird kind of “art”, especially for its time, but I just can’t get past the other 95% of the movies.  This one is a little bit of a cross between <strong>The Little Shop of Horrors (1960)</strong> and <strong>Mother’s Day (1980)</strong>.  A crazy lady owns a wig shop and you’ll never guess how she gets the wigs.. If you didn’t guess, she uses her son to “obtain” the wigs from women.  So that’s where I see the similarities to those two movies.  Outside of that, the majority of the movie is just some nosy college girl snooping around and trying to figure out what’s been happening with these missing/murdered women.  That part is pretty boring and the acting and editing is rough.  I noticed one part where it seemed like they didn’t quite cut the film early enough so you see the actress kind of look up briefly, kind of like Pee-Wee in <strong>Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure (1985)</strong>, the part where he has a cameo in the movie based on his adventure.  Paging Mr Herman… anyway, I’m way off topic.  Long story short, the gore is fine, although the skin makeup is not very convincing.. the premise is all right, but everything else is not great.",

      "Already at the end of our Godzilla set of movies for the watchlist and also at the end of the Showa Era of Godzilla movies.  There’s not much to say that hasn’t been said in the previous Godzilla posts.  This one recaps a lot of the fights from the previous movie, so if you watch one of the two, might as well just skip to this one.  This time, surprise surprise, there are some human-like aliens and Mechagodzilla is back.  There is also a Colonel Sanders looking scientist (without the beard though..) who wants to unleash his Titanosaurus because of some past rejections.  And then you’ve got the good scientists who want to develop technology to stop this Titanosaurus.  What it all boils down to is a fight at the end with Godzilla vs Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla.  The formula is kind of worn out at this point, but I will give this movie some credit for at least getting back to the disaster and panic aspects a LITTLE bit, but not very much.  For the end of the Showa Era, it’s ok, but maybe had they known this would be the last one for a while, they would have gone with a bigger story, more monsters in the mix.  It’s not the worst of the bunch, but after watching nine other similar movies in the past few days, it’s not very impressive.  “You may be a cyborg…but… I still love you”",

I have to say, I’m more interested in getting to the post-Showa Godzillas more than the Showa movies themselves.  But I wanted to go in order, so this was a perfect chance to do that.  As I might have predicted, I wasn’t particularly impressed with any of the movies, but they have a cheesy old-fashioned charm.  Here’s how I would rank this particular set of 10 movies, personally:",
      "<li><strong>Destroy All Monsters </strong>– A big monster battle and, really, isn’t that what we all came here for?</li><li><strong>Godzilla, King of the Monsters!</strong> – Not as good as the original Japanese version, but since it’s mostly highlights from that movie, it’s pretty decent</li><li><strong>Terror of Mechagodzilla</strong> – Pretty repetitive at this point and doesn’t add much, but taken on its own, it’s slightly better than a lot of the other movies, but still pretty goofy</li><li><strong>Godzilla vs Gigan</strong> – The fights are pretty fun, a 2 vs 2 match.  Otherwise, it’s pretty generic</li><li><strong>Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla</strong> – Mechagodzilla is pretty interesting as an enemy, so at least this movie’s got that going for it</li><li><strong>Godzilla vs Hedorah</strong> – A weird one but I kind of like it because it’s a little different</li><li><strong>Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</strong> – This feels a little more “classic” with the Mothra islander stuff, but ultimately, a little boring</li><li><strong>Godzilla vs Megalon</strong> – Super cheesy, from Jet Jaguar to Seatopia.  I guess it’s good for some laughs, but it’s not particularly good</li><li><strong>Son of Godzilla</strong> – Maybe a bit harsh on this one, but Godzilla’s son is just, conceptually, not good.  Who watched the first several Godzilla movies and thought “he needs to be a dad”</li><li><strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> – Well, you know if I’m not a fan of Godzilla’s son, I definitely wouldn’t be a fan of Godzilla’s son appearing to some kid in dreams, talking with him and all that.  Too cheesy and not really in a fun/funny way</li>",
      "There you have it, my take on these Godzilla movies.  I’d have a tough time ranking them alongside some of the other Showa Era films since it’s been a bit since I watched them.. but I’m glad I got to complete the awesome Showa Era Criterion set.  I do have a lot of Godzilla two-packs for the later movies.. but that’s another project for another day..",

The end fight is not bad, Mechagodzilla is cool in a cheesy kind of way with all his electrical and laser effects.  The human side of the story, as always, is not super interesting.  Some old guy praying to a statue, some ape-men masquerading as humans and controlling Mechagodzilla, some regular guys trying to thwart them.  It’s all the same after a while.  Among the catalog of Godzilla movies, it’s pretty bland.  The fight scenes are fun but fairly limited and I didn’t have much interest in the rest of the story.

      "And the Academy Award goes to… not this movie.  Where to even start with this movie.. well, it’s the infamous “Jet Jaguar” movie where a fan-made character somehow ended up in a Godzilla movie.  It was originally supposed to be a Jet Jaguar movie, but they decided to make it into a Godzilla movie for the purpose of better sales.  It kind of shows, too… it’s about 50 minutes before Godzilla finally shows up.  Instead of an alien attack, now it’s a “Seatopia” attack.  Seatopia being some underwater lost civilization that’s pissed off about atomic testing ruining their country.  The scenes of Seatopia are pretty ridiculous too.. finally, there is a fight where Godzilla teams up with Jet Jaguar to fight against the new monster sent by Seatopia, Megalon and, for no reason at all, Gigan.  The fight has ok moments, some good miniature destruction, but some of that might be recycled.  I see that MOBILOIL building a lot.. but there are some ridiculous moments in the fight, lots of taunting and some gravity-defying Godzilla kicks.  The movie is a bit of an eye-roller, but fun in a “laughing at it, not with it” kind of way.  I’m torn between a 4.5 and a 5, but I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt just for the “so bad it’s good” kind of moments.",

      "Already onto #7 of 10 for this week.  Really just making sure I can squeeze them all in since I may not be able to after Thursday.  This movie is very lopsided.  For about 45-50 minutes, you may forget you’re even watching a Godzilla movie.  It really focuses on some side story with the typical good humans vs evil human-like aliens who are controlling two monsters: Ghidorah and the new one, Gigan.  <em>Eventually</em>, Godzilla and his apparent buddy Anguirus make their way to fight those two.  The fight scenes are a little cooler than some of the previous movies.  They are at night, so maybe that helps.. harder to see the little details.  I do think they stole a lot of footage from <strong>Destroy All Monsters</strong>, though.. but it works out ok.  One thing that I’m not a fan of in this and the other recent movies.. they really try to make the monsters have human-like personalities.  “Talking” with each other, “laughing” sometimes?  This one even had some comic book-like speech bubbles with Godzilla talking to Anguirus and Anguirus replying “OK!”.  The human-like traits are just there for comedy and I’d prefer more intimidating monsters myself.. anyway, this is another, like <strong>Destroy All Monsters</strong>, where the last 1/3 mostly make up for a pretty boring first 2/3.",

      "It’s the 1970s now and the topic today is environmentalism.  The whole movie is a warning about pollution with the enemy monster, Hedorah, being a big blob of sludge formed by pollution.  This time, it’s just Godzilla doing the fighting, no baby Godzilla to be found.  This movie is kind of all over the place.. sometimes, it seems to try to have a quiet, somber tone with a serious message, and then other times it’s like a psychedelic music freakout.  There are weird little musical breaks and there is even a short animated sequence.  When it started, it focused a lot on a kid, so I thought “here we go again..”  Fortunately, there is a little less focus on the kid than in the previous movie.. all in all, this was a step up but also.. weird.",

In these dreams, he meets Minilla, who can talk now, and gets inspired to fight against his own bullies and some criminals and.. that’s it.  The monster fight scenes are not great, this new monster is like a lizard cat and looks really cheap and they are always fighting to Austin Powers music.

      "Finally, a giant monster rumble.  Godzilla rolls up with his gang to fight some alien group.  You get scenes of multiple monsters destroying the city and multiple monsters having a WWE-style fight against Ghidora.  It’s a fun fight, although very clunky and, for some reason, Godzilla doesn’t use his greatest skill, the fire breath.  I guess he wanted to make the fight fairer, a man of principle.  Of course, the ending is the best part of the movie.. however, the price to pay to get there is sitting through a lot of typical spacemen vs human-like aliens.  It felt like a <strong>Gamera</strong> movie most of the time, just without the annoying kids.  So it all kind of balances itself out.. as always, more monsters and fewer humans and it’d be a more enjoyable movie.",

If you take that aspect out of it, it’s a typical Godzilla movie.. people on an island, some other monster threats, etc.  The mantis and spider monsters are all right, but it’s hard to take Godzilla seriously in this one.  When standing next to baby Godzilla, he doesn’t look so huge.  The scale is kind of confusing in this movie, actually.. it’s really far from the origins of the Godzilla series, that’s for sure.

I hadn’t really thought about this being a separate movie, but I see it listed as its own thing, so I decided to treat it so.  I saw the original Japanese version a few years ago, so my memory is fuzzy, but this is basically a clip show of the first with scenes of an American reporter cut in to make it look like he was there.  Kind of creative, but pretty unnecessary.  On its own, its fine, but it is pretty obvious when there’s a “new” scene mixed in with an “old” scene.  Also, the reporter’s reactions to some pretty heavy stuff is kind of.. lifeless, so it doesn’t really sell the horror that is going on.  I wouldn’t really recommend it when you have the original already, but if you try to treat it as if it was its own film, it has most of the Godzilla highlights.",

The chariot scene is of course famous and it is a good scene.. but after that, the movie kind of loses steam.  The very ending is a little.. hokey.. but up until then, I appreciated it for just telling a story and not getting overly fixated on the religious aspect.  So it was still good overall, but a lot like <strong>The Alamo (1960)</strong>, it’s epic and enjoyable, but has this old sugar-coated kind of sentiment in there that brings it down just a bit for me.",

      "It’s comedy time.  In all these watchlists, aside from some horror comedy (or comedy horror, depending on how you look at it), I really haven’t touched on comedies at all.  Most of the comedies I own, I’ve already watched.  However, I had this DVD 4-pack that I bought when I was buying random Robin Williams movies (I bought this pack just for <strong>The Birdcage (1996)</strong>) and so I thought I’d toss one in from here.  I may have seen this, or parts of it, a looong time ago because I’m pretty sure my dad had this VHS tape sitting on the shelf at home.  I definitely have some random memory of the dad in the movie dying the baby with the air dryer in the bathroom.  Anyway, it’s a fairly fun movie with a premise that is very.. 80s, I guess.  A dad loses his job, the stay-at-home mom goes back to work and now the dad becomes the stay-at-home parent.  It’s a little outdated to call it “Mr Mom” since it implies stay-at-home parents are strictly moms.  But anyway, different times and all that.  Most of the comedy isn’t exactly hilarious, but there are some fun moments here and there.  I liked the obsession with soap operas.  Michael Keaton is pretty good in it, one of his earlier big movies, but the star of the movie for me is that comfy 80s suburban home vibe.  If I had a time machine..",

Like with any Lynch thing, it’s more about appreciating the surreal-ness of it all.  I’m not one who has to scour a movie for clues and try to find the real meaning of a movie.  But it was a pretty disjointed movie, at first a very slow and dark drama/horror, then all of a sudden a kind of nightmare version of a Tarantino movie with a Wal-Mart-brand Charlie Sheen.  I liked both, but they definitely felt like two separate movies.

It’s definitely worth the watch… but this El Duce guy was about as disgusting as you could imagine.  I’m aware of the “shock rock” type of music, but I’ve never been big into stuff like GG Allin where it’s just shock for the sake of shock.  I do like old school Misfits, but really for the horror aspect.. when they veer a little bit into shock territory, it loses me.  El Duce is basically an alcoholic with mental issues.. either that or a very dedicated troll.  Despite he and the band being pretty disgusting, I’m a sucker for the raw footage and documentaries about old rock bands.  I really like <strong>We Are Twisted Fucking Sister! (2014)</strong> and one of my all-time favorite movies is <strong>Anvil! The Story of Anvil (2008)</strong>.  So this kind of hit that note for me, but in a different way.  It’s just fascinating to watch such a weird dude self-destruct over time.  He himself didn’t seem specifically cruel to others but he promoted some pretty vile stuff that probably influenced way too many guys out there, so it’s hard to sympathize with him.. but it is still sad to see how his life turned out either way.  All in all, really interesting movie and a really unique subject matter for a documentary.  I appreciate the straight footage-based doc with minimal narration (only text-based narration)",

I was always hesitant to watch the prequel because I knew it’d be a long time commitment and because I had read a lot of criticism about how it was kind of a Confederate-sympathizing movie.  Well.. they weren’t wrong about that.  I don’t want to get into the politics of it, but it felt kind of.. gross to be trying to root for these characters, even though, in the movie, they were portrayed as these romanticized “aw shucks, we’re just good old fashioned Southerners” type people.  But in reality.. they were pretty much just cool with slavery?  Anyway.. it is interesting to see movies told from the perspective of the “other” side of a conflict (<strong>Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)</strong> is a good one) and not everything is so black and white, good and evil, etc… but it’s hard to get past this “heroic” portrayal.  Anyway.. putting all that aside, the movie was still too overly dramatic in a kind of Oscar-baity way.

It’s really spurred on by the gorillas though.. those…horrible monkeys.. The chimps are mostly cool though.

      "Ending yet another series.  It’s funny to end this right after <strong>Sartana</strong> because I find these similar in a lot of ways.  Mysterious fighter who is like TOO indestructible, made around the same time (late 60s).. it’s just that one is an Italian western series and the other a Japanese action series.  The <strong>Outlaw</strong> series goes for emotion more than <strong>Sartana</strong> though, which is a big difference.  This movie in particular has a lot of quiet moments compared to the previous movies, at least based on my gut reaction.  But otherwise, it’s the same as ever, so it didn’t really leave a big impression on me.  I did enjoy the final fight with the psychedelic 60s rock band music.  It may be my favorite fight from anywhere in this series.  Another solid movie but also very similar, so it ends up kind of just falling in the middle for me.  If I had seen this as a one-off movie without the others in the series, I’d probably have been more impressed.",

The rock music fight scene, the spilled paint scene, things like that.  Like with <strong>Sartana</strong>, I really can’t rank these because they all blur in my mind.  As a series, it’s pretty good and I’d like to go back and rewatch some of them from time to time",

Based on that, I wasn’t really getting hyped to get back into this series, but I have to say, this was kind of a pleasant surprise.  It still has some super weird moments.. like a blurred part of a dead guy in a bathroom, an out-of-nowhere computerized illustration of some bullets to a head and I’m not sure what was normal in Japan in 2000, but that kids show performance was pretty wild for a kids show..",

The government is oppressive, the apes start to fight back and so on.  Given the time that it was made, right after the late 60s, I can see why they would go for a story about rights and revolution and all that.  I just feel like they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit too much.  Even the officer outfits look like Nazi uniforms.  Caesar’s transformation in the movie seemed a bit awkward to me.  But still, it’s interesting at least.  Totally makes sense that treating the apes like this would backfire and be the starting point for there actually being a “planet of the apes”.  And it felt a little more sci-fi/dystopian than the previous movie, which is good.",

A straightforward revenge movie with some of the visuals in previous entries would have done the job for me.

Anyway, they are seen as some major discovery for their intelligence but it becomes known that they will be a threat to mankind in the distant future and so someone sets out to stop them and so on.  What’s weird about it is that it’s a pretty uneventful movie for something that started as a sci-fi movie about a planet of apes.  It’s mostly a drama with little bits of comedy and action in there.  I kind of went back and forth on whether I liked it or not.  In the end, it ended up dragging on for a while.

The fight scenes have the similar clumsiness to the previous ones where Goro is too untouchable, nobody uses their opportunity to attack him, all that.  And the final fight is surprisingly small.

Mainly it’s because, from what I’ve seen of them, they are so similar.  It’s a bit hard to differentiate between the movies in this series.  That’s not a knock against the movies, it’s just that they are all similarly structured.

His other four I watched as part of my “March Madness” watchlist and I was impressed by all of them.  I was similarly impressed with this…mostly.  What I didn’t enjoy so much was the human drama, which felt a little forced to me and, unfortunately, the last third of the movie is mostly that.  So for most of the movie, I was pretty much on board.  It was still a pretty decent retelling of <strong>Frankenstein (1931)</strong> or a little bit like a serious <strong>Re-Animator (1985)</strong>.  Obviously, the movie is about resurrecting the dead through science and then it going wrong in the end.  Nothing new there, but the Larry Fessenden artistic style added a little bit for me.

      "This is a big “meh”.  It’s both an interesting premise and a dumb premise.  It’s interesting because at least it’s something different.. set in Chernobyl/Pripyat, it’s pretty unique compared to most horror movies.  However, why would anyone want to go there.. that’s the dumb part.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would get excited about going to Chernobyl, enough to suddenly rearrange their existing travel plans.  But however awkward it is to setup the fact that they are in the Chernobyl area, they are there.  Once there, it becomes a typical movie for the era… attempts at jump scares, uninteresting characters, forced drama, you know the routine.  So while I give it some props for a more unique setting, it’s still a pretty underwhelming movie for me and just another below average 2010s movie.",

A bit of <strong>A Dark Song (2016)</strong> for some reason.  But then as the movie got going, it got into the same old 2010s horror that just isn’t my groove.  Boring characters, lots of “use your imagination” moments where it’s just dark and you just have to imagine that something is happening to the main character.  It didn’t really pull me in, even though it started off looking like it was going to me moody and atmospheric.  It’s a pretty average movie, not one I’d watch again, but it’s still a bit of fresh air after the 2000s movies I endured.",

That’s not to say it’s GOOD exactly, but it feels a little more like a “real movie”.  So the filmmaking aspect of it is not too terrible, but definitely limited by its budget.  The characters and the dialog were the areas where I found the movie kind of.. eh.  For such a small budget, the movie was still decently done, which is impressive.  If the characters and humor landed a bit better, I actually would have been fond of this.  It’s actually a fairly wild/fun adventure, just a little awkward in the writing.

However, it’s got a little bit of heart.. it seems like they really <em>tried</em> to make a movie here and they made…something.  With some technical polish and fewer eye-roll moments, it could actually be a passable small-town slasher movie.  But as it is, it’s pretty rough.

I’ll try to just separate the movie from the director here.  I had heard this was a pretty decent early 2000s horror movie, so I thought it’d be worth a watch at some point.  I would say “decent” is about right.. it has some creepy moments but also some ridiculous stuff.  The killer creature here looks like the <strong>Wishmaster (1997)</strong> genie guy, but with some other animal features.  The premise itself is creepy, driving on an isolated road and being chased or hunted by someone.. that’s a bit of a fear of mine.  I mean, what can you really do there?  It has its moments, but it isn’t a classic really.. maybe with a creepier killer, it could work a little better.  It was like a mix of cheap rubber suit + CGI so it kind of undermined the intimidating factor.  An ok movie, but too bad it comes with the director’s baggage..",

      "Ending the 90s similar to how I ended the 80s.  I felt like this would be a fun choice to pair with <strong>DeepStar Six (1989)</strong> since they seem similar from the outset.. both start with “Deep”, both blu-rays released by KL Studios with slipcover and both about underwater ship crews facing some threat.  In the end, they were actually pretty similar, but both fit their decade.  This one gets back to trying to add a little crew chemistry and a little humor, but I don’t think those worked too well.  At least the movie wasn’t afraid to show the monster, although it took a while to get to the “horror” part of the movie.  The first half just felt like any generic 90s action movie, but it eventually gets there.  This is that awkward period for CGI, but I’ve seen worse than the creature here, so it actually wasn’t too embarrassing.  It’s cheesy, it’s a little late 90s stank, but it’s all right for a horror action type of movie.  What really got on my nerve was the Joey character and the way he talked.  One of those unfunny comic relief characters with a voice that sounds almost like the pimple-faced teenager from The Simpsons.  ",
      "After watching this, I find it funny that a lot of these “crew” movies have a very similar pairing.. <strong>Galaxy of Terror (1981)</strong> and <strong>Forbidden World (1982)</strong> both early 80s space crew movies.  <strong>Leviathan (1989) </strong>and <strong>DeepStar Six (1989)</strong>, both late 80s deep sea crew movies.  <strong>Deep Rising (1998)</strong> and <strong>Ghost Ship (2002)</strong> are sea crews who find a cruise ship with some.. problems.

Again, it’s another one of those “isolated crew” movies, but this time they don’t try to play up the crew in a jokey was with some forced chemistry.  It’s tone is a bit more serious throughout the movie.  The cast is decent and the setting and visuals are pretty cool.. but even this movie isn’t free of the late 90s stank with a little bit of noticeable bad CGI and things like that.  Although I would put it above the other “isolated crew” movies I’ve seen lately, it’s not <em>quite</em> my style.  There is a lot of psychological type of horror, which isn’t my thing, but it does get into more physical horror later, so it still is pretty good for my tastes.  All in all, pretty good and imaginative, interesting premise and decent acting.. but it doesn’t quite have a “timeless” feel due to its late 90s style.  Because of that late 90s stank on a spaceship, every once in a while, it feels like just a few steps away from <strong>Jason X (2001)</strong> and that’s somewhere you don’t want to be.",

It’s more of a supernatural let’s summon demons type of movie.  It’s also a bad acting and awkward dialog type of movie.  There’s a little bit of casual racism thrown in the mix.. and some really strange narration, this is supposed to be the main girl narrating 30 years later?  Sounds like she took up smoking in those 30 years.  Anyway, it’s an ok premise.. a group of friends out skiing, one gets injured and they have to take shelter in a cabin until they can get help.  <em>Eventually</em> there’s the “let’s summon demons” part.  It’s just a little bit dated and, as I mentioned, pretty awkwardly executed.  It definitely feels more like a mid-80s movie rather than a 1993 movie.  It’s hard for me to believe that this movie and <strong>Jurassic Park (1993)</strong> could have come out in the same year.  It still has the 80s slasher feel anyway, despite not being one, because people are getting killed one by one, there is a final girl that discovers all of the bodies, etc.  There’s just not a “real” slasher.  But because of that similarity in its feel, I kind of rate it from that 80s slasher mindset, in which case, it’s like.. average or maybe even a bit below average.  The soundtrack’s funny too.. there is some weird 3 Blind Mice remix, not sure the relevance of that.",

I will say that I was not super interested in it previously, which explain why I watched maybe 45 minutes of it and never followed up.  I appreciate the creativity in the monster and world design, but the premise and the production somehow just don’t do much for me.  Maybe it’s that early 90s feel.. the soundtrack that is kind of too dramatic, I’m not sure.  After watching the whole thing, I still feel similar..

I guess I was in the mood for some deep sea creature movie along the lines of <strong>Leviathan (1989)</strong>.  That’s probably a pretty common comparison to make since these came out the same year.  Just looking it up now, apparently this came out a couple months before Leviathan.  Unfortunately, I got a lot more “use your imagination” from this movie until the finale.  Most of the movie just felt like a crew dealing with technical issues and less about the threat of some creature.  As far as the crew goes, there are some noticeable actors here (two “Lloyds”.. Lloyd Braun from Seinfeld and Lloyd Henreid from The Stand 90s miniseries).  They’re fine but it feels like the movie tries a little too hard to make this crew feel like a worn-in crew who have a chemistry with each other.  It felt a little forced to me, but I guess that’s the problem with a lot of these crew-based movies.  I still do like these types of movies, as I know I’ve mentioned the similarities before.  In all these watchlists, I’ve gotten a handful of these movies.. off the top of my head: <strong>Galaxy of Terror (1981)</strong>, <strong>Forbidden World (1982)</strong>, <strong>Leviathan (1989)</strong> and <strong>Ghost Ship (2002)</strong>.

They have Michael Richards, but his character is just a little too goofy.  Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are the leads and they are pretty likable.  Their jokes don’t always land but you root for them anyway.  For the first half of the movie, I was a little put off by the dumbness and predictability of the humor.. but about midway through, things start to get more interesting and it kind of won me over by the end.  It’s still not a great comedy, but it’s light and harmless.  How could I give this anything other than a 6.5… it’s practically in the title.",

It takes place in some woods/forest, but it’s more <strong>The Prey (1983)</strong> or <strong>Don’t Go in the Woods (1981) </strong>than the <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> movies.  There isn’t a very large cast of characters.. and the characters are pretty meh.  I know, it’s a slasher, who cares about characters, but still.. While the four main characters are pretty uninteresting, the killer (which is not some unknown mystery killer) is just off enough to be a little creepy.  There are also a couple of kid characters, son of this mountain man killer and somehow one of the two kids seems to have a British accent..?  Not sure where you’d pick that up in rural America.  This movie is probably right in the middle of the of the pack of 80s slashers.  The quality of the movie is a little better than some I’ve seen, but the slasher aspects are fairly lacking.",

What I actually kind of liked about the movie was the “buddy” aspect, with the two main characters teaming up and going on a journey to investigate and save people from the piranhas.  I also liked the summer camp aspect as well, but I’m a sucker for those kinds of movies.  Those things were nice, but the rest of it was a little cheap and a little clunky.. but it’s hard to make something like this work.  Jaws works through the power of suggestion.

It’s funny, this movie is a little bit similar to that and with a bit of the atmosphere of <strong>The Changeling (1980)</strong>.  But this came before either movie, so it’s not a rip-off.. but it’s definitely much less interesting than either of those.  It just goes on way too long with a lot of nothing happening.  The ending finally has some interesting things happening, but I don’t know what sense it really makes.  The rest of the time, it just felt like a family drama with two parents and their son as caretakers of a big house with a pool.

However, the execution wasn’t quite there for me, but it wasn’t bad.  The “sex zombie” thing is a little awkward at times, but it still mostly works as if it were a normal zombie movie.  It takes a while to get going, but the last third is where it starts to finally deliver on the premise  It reminds me a lot of <strong>Rabid (1977)</strong> (not too shocking, both are David Cronenberg) in that it takes a while to build up the but the last third or so is when things start going nuts.  I liked Rabid and I like this one, maybe just a little bit less.  Just based on the setting alone, I couldn’t hate it.  The idea of a self-contained apartment high-rise with its own shops, dentist, doctor’s office, etc, having some kind of emergency is naturally interesting to me.

I like <strong>Dressed to Kill (1980)</strong> and<strong> Blow Out (1981)</strong> and of course he’s done other bigger movies later that are good too, but more outside the horror realm.  I had watched some of his earlier movies in that DeNiro+De Palma set months ago.. and those were a little rough, but fine for such early movies.  So I was curious to see a suspense/thriller movie of his that was before the two I mentioned, even before <strong>Carrie (1976)</strong>.  I had already seen some clips from this movie, so I got the basic idea being about a girl who kills and there being the idea of a sister, but whether the sister was real or not was up for grabs.  This movie pretty much was as I expected, although I was much more interested at the beginning and I felt a lull when it became more investigative.. which is weird, I usually like the investigation part of these movies.  Anyway, I still enjoyed it overall and it felt like an American giallo.  I own but still haven’t seen <strong>Obsession (1976)</strong>, another De Palma film, so I’m looking forward to watching that one at some point.  Anyway, Sisters was a good lead-up to <strong>Dressed to Kill</strong> and <strong>Blow Out</strong>, but not <em>quite</em> at that level for me.",

But overall, if you look it at it like a modern (well, modern for 1970..) imagining of Dracula, it’s not bad.  It’s nice to see a Dracula-like character outside of the older gothic style setting.

You have some people talking supernatural/demons stuff, and then the pursuit to reach someone from beyond and that kind of stuff, so it’s a bit more supernatural or pseudo-supernatural.

This is an interesting one.. it’s got a younger, skinnier Sid Haig and an older and still likeable Lon Chaney Jr.  In a way, it’s a little bit of a precursor to <strong>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)</strong> in that there is a weird and crazy family that’s bad news for visitors.  It’s not so insane, though.  For me, horror in the 30s, 40s and 50s were pretty tame.  I have to imagine that, even for their time periods, they weren’t very scary for the audience.  After <strong>Psycho (1960)</strong>, there was a transition starting where the 60s had a few movies starting to get a little weird with it.  H.G Lewis got pretty wild with blood and gore and <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968)</strong> was also pretty dark and gruesome.  What does all that have to do with Spider Baby… well, I think it’s a good example of the late 60s starting to lean towards some of those wilder movies of the 70s.  It’s not extreme itself, but it’s transitional.  Also there’s a funny little meta shout-out to the Wolf Man at the dinner table.

So I kind of have seen it.  I don’t remember too many specifics about Blood of Ghastly Horror, so I can’t do a good comparison.  What I will say is that this seemed worse.. clunkier editing and pretty light on the horror.  I do remember feeling that Blood of Ghastly Horror was a slight step up from some of the other Al Adamson movies I watched that week, but this feels a level lower.. so maybe the re-edit improved the movie a little bit.

There’s a coziness to those and I’ll have to find some more.  This particular movie has a bit of that small-town feel, but the town isn’t much of a “character” here.  It’s really about some Evil Corporation and some.. weird little..alien-like creatures/growths.. and of course the WolfCop working with town police dept to stop the Evil Corporation.  Still goofy, but still felt like a breath of fresh air after most of the movies in this watchlist.

It’s not particularly good, but it feels like any 80s teen comedy, like a second-rate John Hughes movie.  It’s cheesy and things like the singing performance at the party was too much for me, but otherwise, I’m not sure what this movie did to offend viewers so much to get below a 2 on Letterboxd.  That’s usually reserved for the worst of the worst and this didn’t seem so bad.  I liked the cast, there were some fun moments, but it’s cheesy and predictable.  And it feels so 80s, which doesn’t hurt.  I wouldn’t stick my neck out for this film, but I would say it’s not a bad watch.. definitely not as bad as the reviews make it out to be.  Maybe some people just really like basketball but hate boxing, I dunno.",
      "6/10",
      "Both movies are similar in tone and the second doesn’t do anything new and probably just copies every other comedy from the period, but I think watching both together could be a fun experience.  Just don’t take it too seriously.  Of course, the first is better and more memorable but as a double feature, still not bad.  There have been a surprising number of werewolf-related movies in this watchlist… <strong>House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, She-Wolf of London</strong> and now this.  But that might not be the last of them…",

I don’t remember particularly liking <strong>Ghoulies (1984)</strong>, mainly because I felt the creatures were underused and I seem to remember it being a lot about the supernatural/summoning stuff.. but it’s been a bit so maybe I’m remembering completely wrong.  This time, the little Ghoulies are featured pretty heavily, so that’s a step up.  This time, it takes place in a carnival setting with a spooky haunted house type attraction, which I like.  But other than that, the creatures are pretty cheap, it’s hard to overlook the blatant <strong>Gremlins (1984)</strong> ripoff and the comedy is a little flat.  It’s cheesy in a way that <strong>Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988)</strong> is, but without the charm.  There’s some fun here and there, but only because of its setting and time period.",

This is just a two-movie series (not including remakes), so I don’t even know if that’s considered a series.  But I finished it anyway and it’s not great, but it’s got a lot of the typical slasher staples, so it’s kind of what you’d expect of an 80s slasher, for better or worse.  The characters and acting are not too great, of course, and the music really seems to ripoff the music from the <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> series.  So this feels like a Friday the 13th movie but in a completely different setting (desert) and with no Jason.

This series is really late in the context of the classic Universal monsters, although it doesn’t really feel any different from the ones that came 10-15 years before it.  There isn’t much new here, still a lot of human drama but at least the Creature is the focus and is shown a fair amount.  However, they put some outfit on him that kind of looks like he is wearing a dirty business suit, which is kind of ridiculous.  Also, for most of the time he is on screen, he is doing nothing but watching and reacting.  The human characters are the same old thing, heroic leading man, a woman with a pretty terrible husband, some other guy constantly chasing her.  Most of the movie drags but the final scenes are actually pretty good and bumped up my view of the movie as a whole.  If they just featured the monster DOING stuff throughout the movie, here and there, this could have been a pretty good one.  In the end, it’s just an ok movie with a satisfying ending.",

However, it’s a cool monster and a lot different than the other monsters with castles and opera houses, so these movies do stand out a bit.  I like the change in scenery, but, like the Wolf Man, wish they found more to do with the monster.",
      "And now, finishing that, I’ve watched every movie in the Universal Classic Monsters 30-film blu-ray set (31 if you include the Spanish Dracula).  Whew!  That’s a lot of monsters.  I had watched the original movies years ago and maybe a sequel here and there, but it wasn’t until this blog and the watchlists that I really started making my way through the remaining sequels and related films.  Just in this watchlist alone, I knocked out 10 of them, and I know a few came up in previous watchlists.  So anyway.. it was a ride, but only a handful of movies (mostly the originals) stick out to me as ones I’d ever watch again.  Some of the movies turned to comedy/action/adventure and away from the original dread and creepy vibe of the originals, so that’s where they started to lose me.  You get different actors for the monsters as time goes and so the later movies just feel like imitations.  I appreciate what these movies are, and the fact that they were a “cinematic universe” before any of the superhero stuff today, but <em>most</em> of the movies in this collection are not particularly interesting or entertaining.  They are comfortable though, so it’s great to have the set for a rainy day.",

Yeah, basically, this movie is not too exciting.  On the surface, it has the same look and feel as the other Universal movies, decent enough acting and sets, all that.

      "Like I mentioned before, there is one that <em>sort of</em> counts as part of the <strong>Dracula</strong> series, but only sort of.  This is the Spanish version of Dracula, filmed separately but simultaneously during the original English language version.  Aside from a different director, crew and cast, it’s the same movie and sets.  I guess, being an early sound film, they hadn’t figured out that this might not be the most efficient way to make movies for multiple languages.  Anyway, it’s been a while since I watched the original (English) Dracula, so it’s hard for me to do a real comparison.  I will say that I’m team Bela Lugosi/Dwight Frye, although this version of Dracula and Renfield was still pretty good.  Some people point out the direction of this version being more dynamic than the English and that’s probably true, but what I noticed the most is that both had the same atmosphere.. lots of silence, very slow pace.  I think that’s where they kind of lose me in either of these Dracula movies.  There are cool scenes, fun performances, but part of me wishes they could just condense it down a little bit to get rid of some of those spaces between the fun stuff.  But I also do like the weirdness that comes with the silence and pacing, so it’s not all bad.. it’d just be a more entertaining watch for me if they could trim out some of those slow spots.  Still though, both versions are classic movies, though dated, but I still cut them some slack for how old they are.",

The original (and the Spanish version) has a certain quality to it and everything after just gets lost in the shuffle of the many Universal horror sequels",

It’s a little ambiguous here due to there being several crossovers in some of these Universal movies, so I’m calling this one the last of the Frankenstein series, even if the monster may appear in another series.. anyway, confusing.  Although this is called <strong>House of Frankenstein</strong>, the doctor isn’t in it and the monster is <em>barely</em> in it.  It’s another mad scientist movie and has more Dracula and Wolf Man participation.  As fun as it is sometimes to have these monster mash-up movies, they always feel too scattered, like they are two or three separate movies.  You’ve got Dracula working his magic over some girl, “friend Daniel” and his fixation on another girl and the mad doctor of the movie trying to get Frankenstein’s lab notes.  The main good thing here is that they got Boris Karloff (as the doctor though, not the monster) and Lon Chaney Jr.  But otherwise, it’s pretty run-of-the-mill for the series and doesn’t stand out much to me.  These old movies sometimes.. like, when someone is going to kill someone, they stick their hands out and slowly approach the other person.  And the person just screams “nooo”.. like, just move.  Anyway, it’s a product of its time, for better or worse.",

Besides being a little too over-the-top, the fact that it kind of ditched the whole premise of the series (“[REC]” referring to the camera recording) and most of the movie is just filmed like.. a normal movie.  I don’t particularly like found footage but still.. you gotta stick to your guns.  Show some integrity.  The premise is pretty fun at least… an outbreak at a wedding, with an old Spanish chapel place and some underground tunnels.  If it had executed on that premise a little better (get to the action quicker, I don’t care about people pretending to be cool/funny people at a wedding… not so over-the-top, better characters, things like that), it’d be my kind of movie.  “Zombie” outbreak in a specific, confined area.. that’s cool.

What’s weird is that I was so sure I watched it as part of a watchlist, but looking back, I didn’t have this in that Halloween 2018 watchlist, although I did watch it in between those movies.  I guess I wasn’t as strict with my watchlist management back then, a shame I will forever live with.   So anyway, my memory of the first <strong>[Rec] (2007)</strong> is that it was.. fine.  I’m not a big found footage guy, but I am a zombie guy, so I was kind of on board, but not as much as if it was just a normally shot movie.  In the end, it was told in a pretty interesting way, of course I always like seeing the zombie (or zombie-like) outbreak “as it happens”, but it didn’t leave a big impression on me.  Fast forward 2.5 years later to today, May 11 2021, and here we are with the sequel.  It’s not my jam.. more found footage, as expected, but now we’re talking demons, possessions, priests.. for me, it veered off from an interesting premise in the first movie to a modern-day exorcism type movie (not my style) wrapped in a found footage package (also.. not my style).  So that’s a couple big negatives right out of the gate.  The positive side is that it still has some of that chaos/confusion aspect that makes those zombie/infected/whatever movies interesting and I feel like some of the actors were really giving it their all so.. kudos to them.

They are there and there are some interesting kills, but most of the movie is about the crew and ol Charlie showing up, as usual.

      "More Critters and even a little goofier this time.  The series has started to get into that “kid’s movie” territory, sort of like the <strong>Gamera</strong> movies.  I guess the earlier movies in this series were a little like that.. the adults who won’t believe them, etc.  But this one just felt like a kid’s movie I would have watched in the 90s but with more monster destruction.  Speaking of the kids.. the cast is ok.  I don’t really see the kid that played Josh going anywhere with his career.  The other characters feel a little cartoonish or exaggerated in some ways.  Ol Charlie is back and still goofy.. the Critters still look like little ball puppets with some “comedic” personalities.  For someone who likes part 2, then this one is ok, but just like a lesser part 2.  Also, this movie ends on a “To Be Continued…” which is very odd for movies to do.  They must have been sure that Critters 4 funding was coming in when they did that.  Either way, the suspense is unbearable…",

I don’t remember a lot about <strong>Critters (1986)</strong>, except for the song they kept playing over and over.. The Power of the Night!  So coming into this, I was not really up-to-date on the Critter situation, but I don’t think that was necessary.  There are some recurring characters that I didn’t recognize, but other than that, you’ve got an outbreak of Critters terrorizing a small town, what more do you need.  I guess I didn’t realize in the first movie that Malarkey from Band of Brothers was in it.. but I recognized him this time.  Also, one more useless point.. I wonder if there’s any connection between the Hungry Heifer here and in Cheers..?  Ok, talking about the actual movie now, the creatures are kind of dumb, the premise is kind of predictable but.. it’s kind of fun.  Objectively, it feels like a pretty bad movie, but it has something.. heart, charm, burgers, I don’t know what.. that appeals to me.  I like the fact that the people just hole up in the church and start to get a little crazy.. it’s the same thing that appeals to me in <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968)</strong>.  Otherwise, it’s cheap and cheesy, but it’s entertaining enough.",

It’s really kind of a re-hash of the original, even the death scenes are similar.  Instead of a boy, you’ve got a girl.  Instead of a dog, you’ve got a.. dog, still.  Instead of the dad doing the research, you’ve got the mom.  Instead of photographer sidekick, you’ve got a private investigator.  So it’s really like a half-remake, but worse than the original.  I was ready to go pretty low on this one when they introduced all these metaphysics people… but then the later half won me over a <em>little</em> bit when following the investigator.  Had the whole movie been more about the investigator, I think I’d have been more ok with this movie.  As it stands, it’s nothing new and it’s worse than the ones that came before it.",

I doubt I’m unique in that aspect.. I’m a big fan of The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby, while a slow burn, is still well-made.  So after those two, the first Omen movie is just like “oh evil kid.. sure, cool..”.  In this movie, Evil Kid is now Evil Adult and he knows it.  I kind of liked Evil Kid more because it wasn’t clear if he really <em>knew</em> he was the Antichrist.  Evil Adult knows it and loves it.. anyway, it’s a bit slow, even a little boring at times, but there are some cool moments and Sam Neill is pretty convincing as a creepy Antichrist.  I liked that there was a team of priests trying to take him down, some kind of religious Justice League.  But overall, it was kind of “eh” for me.. maybe because religious horror just isn’t my bag, baby.",

I wasn’t sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn’t expect to go down the path of a boxing comedy.. but here we are.  It’s fun, though.. and some of the physical comedy seemed a little tighter than the other Abbott and Costello Meet movies.. particularly the money exchange bit.

It goes downhill after that and eventually becomes kind of a novelty.. <strong>The Invisible Woman (1940)</strong> and <strong>The Invisible Agent (1942)</strong> are just mindless “superhero”-ish movies.  Kind of undermines the concept.  <strong>The Invisible Man’s Revenge (1944)</strong> gets it back on track, at least.

This gets back to the original movie’s formula, where it’s the one who is invisible that becomes the monster.  For that reason, I like it better than <strong>The Invisible Agent (1942)</strong> and for sure better than <strong>The Invisible Woman (1940)</strong>.  The movie is straightforward and back to its horror roots, but still with a little bit of comedy, mainly from the friend of the main character who takes him in and gives him shelter.  He’s a pretty likable character: “I stuck by you when you were poor.  You don’t think I’m going to desert you, now you’re rich”.  The effects in the movie are ok, but there are some scenes where the “invisible” part is slightly visible and I don’t think they do anything really novel compared to the previous Invisible movies.  It’s an ok movie, but it gets some points for not being an action/adventure/comedy again",

I feel this movie is a little more exciting than <strong>The Mummy’s Tomb</strong>, but not much.  It’s fairly outdated with some of its characters, but I guess that’s just a sign of the times..  The plot is pretty simple, two men are looking for the remains of the mummy, a girl awakens with no memory and in a daze, saying the name Kharis and, of course, this mummy is looking for her too.  The mummy slowly shuffles, the people stand and scream.. it’s more of what you expect.  I feel similar to how I did when watching the <strong>Gamera</strong> series back-to-back.. it’s almost impossible to tell many of them apart and I don’t think they are meant to be watched in that way because, if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen most of them.

      "And onto another watchlist.  To start, I’m finishing the original Universal Mummy series.  Let me start by saying that, as far as Universal monsters go, the Mummy character never really interested me, but I’m not sure why.. Dracula has the most charismatic monster, Frankenstein has the most sympathetic monster, the Wolfman has the most tragic monster, the Invisible Man has the most interesting premise.  After that, the Phantom, the Creature and the Mummy are just kind of… whatever to me.  <strong>The Mummy (1932)</strong> was one I watched a while ago, but my main memory was that it was just a little too slow and boring.  I will say that the Mummy is the coolest/creepiest-looking monster of the group, but I feel he is never used in a scary enough way.. maybe because, by nature, he is sooo slow.  The Mummy’s Tomb is really more of the same.. you have a villainous human who is trying to capture this girl for some ancient marriage ceremony or something to continue this mummy’s legacy blah blah.  So the mummy creature takes a bit of a backseat, although the main villain is still done pretty well.  Outside of that, if you’ve seen one Mummy movie, you’ve seen this one so it’s fine.  I know I liked it better than <strong>The Mummy’s Hand (1940)</strong>, which I recall having some C-rate Abbott and Costello duo.  This was just ok for me, but not the worst in the series.",

I guess because it’s a more relatable situation, time and place for someone like me.  Every other drama I watched this time around was some period piece, mostly outside the US, so while I can appreciate the drama, it’s hard to put myself in those shoes.  Marriage Story is purely a personal drama about marriage, divorce, parenthood and custody.  It feels the most “real life” to me.. just normal people in normal circumstances.  The movie is smaller in scope and focuses entirely on the two main characters and it seems like watching a play (or maybe I just felt that due to them being a play director/actress).  It makes me think of <strong>Whiplash (2014)</strong> in a way.. the kind of movie that I’d rewatch just to enjoy the performances and the natural progression of the story.  Knowing <em>what</em> happens in these movies is fine to focus on the first watch, but after that, just rewatching for <em>how</em> it happens makes it worth revisiting.

Although I’ve owned the movie for maybe a year, I just never felt in the “mood” for this style of movie, despite it having that hype.  It can be hard to sit down for 2 hr 15 min black and white foreign-language film.. I know, I know.. I’m weak.  It’s not to say I don’t like those, it’s just an investment.  Finally sitting down to watch it, I did find it very engaging and a little “hypnotic” in how slow the camera moved.  The movie is kind of one of those “slice of life” type movies where it’s really just about a time/place and someone’s experience in that time.. where the story and actions are less important.  The main character is a maid for a family in Mexico in the early 1970s.  Once I got used to the pace and the idea that not a lot “happens” (in terms of specific actions), I started to enjoy it better.  Visually, the movie is great… but.. I can’t help but wonder what it would look like in color.  Yeah, I’m one of those people.  Not anti-black&amp;white movies.. I just imagine this era would have had some really vibrant and distinct colors.  And some long-lasting shots must have taken forever to get right.  Also, this is another movie where the sound is really natural, no soundtrack over the top to try to heighten the drama.  Overall, I struggled a little with the pacing and got a little tired of seeing this family.. but I definitely can recognize how impressive the filmmaking is and I did enjoy it in the end.",

The way the movie plays out is very straight.. not a lot of overdramatics or music to evoke emotion, just the events as they happen, so that makes it feel a little more brutal.  The premise is based on a real life hotel manager in Rwanda who gets caught up in the genocide and risks his own life (and money) to protect others.  It’s a little like <strong>Schindler’s List (1993)</strong> in some ways, but here, the main character is caught up in the chaos and confusion himself.  One thing I like in movies is when they capture an “as it happens” type thing.  For example (completely different movie..), <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968)</strong> has that.  Maybe my favorite thing about that movie is that the viewer is watching everything go down as the characters are.. learning about things from the radio, from stories from other people, etc.   This movie has that to a degree and that makes it more interesting to me.  Overall, it’s a good movie, but I don’t know if it’s one that I’d go back and watch repeatedly just because of it’s depressing tone.",

Danny Glover was a bastard man.  Anyway, the movie’s story is not so well-structured for me.  It really just follows one character as she grows up in a household where she faces and witnesses racism, sexism, abuse, but also bonds with other girls.  From what I’ve read about the responses to this movie, a lot of people feel like it was Steven Spielberg Oscar-baiting hard.  I can kind of get that.. it’s a delicate subject matter and should evoke some strong emotions and that’s usually what gets those Oscar votes.  The difference is when it feels like the goal is to get Oscar attention vs to tell the story.  It’s hard to say if he is veering towards the former here, but there is a little bit of a “sugary” feel to the storytelling, style, music.. but anyway, it’s still good, but I wonder if the story could have been told in a “stronger” way to really emphasize the bad so that the good stands out more.

I don’t know much else about his life, so I have no idea if much of this movie is based on truth.  Either way, it’s a pretty brutal look at how society treats those who are different.  From the start, you already sympathize with John, so seeing him treated like a freak already gets you upset.  It’s got a good cast and is directed by David Lynch, although this is probably the most “straight” David Lynch thing I’ve seen.

The actual movie is interesting, though.  The part that appeals to me the most is the “survival” aspect.  He has nothing but has to find the means to survive and escape, so as a viewer, you get that tension.  Of course, the movie probably wouldn’t be as well-remembered if it didn’t have Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as the leads.  It’s really a simple premise: a man is convicted of murdering his wife, but he didn’t do it.. he is imprisoned but gets an opportunity to escape the prison bus so he does and then works to prove his innocence, but while being pursued by a federal marshal.  Gets right to the point, I like it.  My main complaint is the length of the movie… 2 hr 10 min is quite a bit for this premise.  While it’s good, I think some things could have been condensed or cut to make it just a little tighter and move along better.  But I’m no movie critic, what do I know.

These action movies perfectly fit the bill for what I expected</li>",

      "Another movie that’s I’ve surprisingly not seen.  I have seen <strong>National Lampoon’s Loaded Weapon 1 (1993)</strong> several times and I’ve seen It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s “Lethal Weapon” movies… so I had a good idea of what this was all about.  Reliable, straight-edge cop is paired up with an unstable, unorthodox cop and they work together to take down some criminal organization.  This is one I always associated with <strong>Die Hard (1988)</strong> because of the time it was released as well as having several sequels through the late 80s and 90s.  They even both have Christmas backdrops.  So going into it with everything I already knew, there wasn’t too much in the way of surprises, but it’s an enjoyable movie, mainly because of the relationship between the two main characters.  I guess this is THE buddy cop movie, just like <strong>Dirty Harry</strong> is THE loose cannon movie.  Good acting by the leads, but the overall story feels a little “typical”.. maybe it’s just been emulated too much since, so it doesn’t stand out anymore.  But I think a Lethal Weapon + Die Hard Christmas double feature would be someday..",

      "I’ve seen most of Clint Eastwood’s westerns and a handful of his post-2000s movies, but I have a bit of a blindspot in his career between those two… a lot of action movies, at one point he even teams up with a monkey..?  Anyway, Dirty Harry is referenced enough in other things that I couldn’t help but be a little familiar with it.. “well, do ya, punk?” of course.  I liked this one quite a bit and, hey, coincidentally two San Francisco action movies in a row.  I think half the fun in this movie is getting to see someone do what it takes to get a job done, which sometimes is just more effective.  Of course, in real life, this probably wouldn’t work out so well.. but it’s Clint Eastwood, you know he’s gonna win.  I get Homer watching “McGarnagle” on The Simpsons:",

      "The only thing I really knew about this movie was that it had Steve McQueen and one of those most famous car chase scenes.  It’s a little light on the action compared to what I expected, but I actually like that slower burn in this movie.  The premise is just that the main character has the job of defending someone who is to be a witness, but things go a little south.. Pretty simple premise, but it has a little bit of that <strong>Godfather (1972)</strong> element of someone trying to get to someone at a hospital.  And of course the car chase scene is pretty good.. I normally don’t really care about car chases, but something about the way this was shot with some shots from inside the car.. as well as being on the hilly San Francisco streets.. it’s pretty fun to watch.  In the end, it’s a decent action movie with a nice tone and a good cast (Mr Roper!)",

      "The first James Bond movie is about as “classic action” as it gets.  It’s probably a little wild that I haven’t seen the first James Bond movie but.. I’ll go a step further: I’ve never seen any James Bond movie.  Sure, I’ve seen clips, I’ve seen parodies and I played GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64… but, not being a big action guy, I never sat down to watch one.  That might be heresy but I’ve righted the wrong now.  After watching this one, I can understand why it became as popular as it did.  I really doubt there was anything quite like it in the early 60s and I can tell that it influenced action movies for decades after.  Watching it now, it’s still a fun adventure and, yeah, a bit dated culturally, but taking it for what it is, it’s fun.  I wasn’t expecting this movie to be so..tropical.  In my mind, I imagined James Bond always in urban areas, casinos, big formal gatherings, etc.  But it makes for a good adventure and they do end up in the bad guy’s evil base eventually.  I would watch more of the classic James Bond movies at some point, assuming they kind of build on this template.",

      "This had it all.. sex, drugs, and UFOs.  Definitely the “grittiest” of this group of sci-fi movies I watched.  It also has my favorite style of the bunch, although the music is sometimes a little strange.  It feels like I’m listening to SNES boss music or something.  But it all fits together pretty well to make a unique setting, very 80s artsy/hipster.  While I may not really “get” the point of it all, the experience is interesting.  It’s hard to even explain what the plot is.. there are a couple performance art/fashion model type girls and a lot of encounters with drugs, abuse and a weird photo shoot crew… and then also some guy who studies UFOs is mixed in there.  Pretty weird, but it’s a cool time capsule of a kind of 80s subculture and it’s a pretty fun experience.",

And it’s more fantasy than sci-fi.  Anyway, this is a movie I knew nothing about when I first saw it at the movie store, but I was pretty intrigued by the style, just looking at it.  The animation is cool and the visual style is interesting, but it’s also kind of inconsistent.  The music is definitely a product of its time.. funky, psychedelic.  The premise is nothing fancy.. magic vs technology and brother vs brother, but it’s the style that makes it unique.  While it gets points for being visually interesting, the rest of it was just kind of underwhelming.  The voice acting sometimes seemed really awkward or just didn’t seem to match the style and tone of the movie.  Like the main wizard character sounded a little like some NYC wise guy.. I dunno.

Anyway, I have to think it was a difficult movie to adapt from a book given the jumps back and forth in time.  That part was interesting.. but as far as sci-fi goes, there is very little in that regard, besides the “time travel” aspect and the planetary dome where “future Billy” lives.  The rest of the movie is more like a light historical war drama with some “older Billy” life moments peppered in.  I have to say, I don’t really “get” it.  It’s an interesting idea, sure, but I guess I’m not sure what it’s trying to say.  The movie just felt like it was dragging to me.  It felt a lot longer than it was.

      "At first, I was really confused by this prequel to <strong>Cool Runnings (1994)</strong>.  Yeah, kidding.  I bought this solely because it was Arrow and it looked promising.. 70s sci-fi with Bruce Dern.  It ends up being a kind of one-man show in a space base/station, which reminds me of <strong>Moon (2009)</strong> with Sam Rockwell.  However, Moon seemed to deal a lot more with philosophical topics and the question of identity.. Silent Running feels a bit more like a hippie nature movie but in space.  I don’t know if I really “got” the point other than this guy really wanted to preserve the forest on the space station and was going a little crazy.  The aesthetic is good.. about what I would expect from this era of sci-fi.. and the setup got me ready for something good.. but in the end, it didn’t quite live up to all that.  Partly because, like I said, I wasn’t sure what the point of it all was.  Second, although he does a decent job most of the time, sometimes the acting is a little awkward.. I don’t know if part of that is supposed to be how the character is or if they could have tried a few more takes to get something a little better.  It’s still an all right movie, but I had higher expectations for it.  If you like space sci-fi but with hippie nature folk music, this is it.",

      "Starting the sci-fi group with a movie I was mostly familiar with due to the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror segment that parodied it.  I like the “last person alive” type of premise (ok, he isn’t the last person alive) since I think everyone wonders what they’d do if they had the whole world to themselves but were alone.  I guess I’d still collect movies, but may I’d move into an old video rental store.  After a while, a person would go crazy.  In a movie like this, I would have liked to see more of the “as it happened” aspect, instead of just dropping in when this guy has already been living this way for a while.  I think the physical and mental survival is the more interesting part of a post-apocalyptic setting.  I’ve seen <strong>The Last Man on Earth (1964)</strong> so I was aware of the premise from the original novel, but I wasn’t really aware that this movie was based on the same source.  For some reason, I thought there was a different angle to this one, so I guess I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t.

I’m always skeptical of sequels that come out way after the original(s).. it’s hard to capture something so many years later.  Second of all, I’m a big fan of <strong>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989)</strong> because that’s one of those fundamental movies in my childhood, so the only reason i gave this movie a watch is because of that soft spot.  In the end, I found this to be a fun tribute to the originals with a lot of small references and callbacks.  For someone not familiar with originals, it may be hard to “get” and I wouldn’t blame someone for considering this a “meh” movie.  It does have some problems that even a Bill and Ted fanboy can’t get over.. the ending is a bit.. much for me.  And I really wish the daughter characters had a bit more of their own unique personalities.  It seemed like a Bill and Ted impersonation and it was awkward for me.  Otherwise, I enjoyed most of the humor and the movie was entertaining and never boring.  So for an average viewer, I guess this probably comes in as a middle-of-the-road movie… not good, not bad.

      "The adventures continue.  I like the idea of big monsters like Godzilla and King Kong, but there aren’t a lot of big monster movies that I actually like.  The original <strong>Godzilla (1954)</strong> and <strong>King Kong (1933)</strong> are good for their times, but watching them today, I mainly only appreciate their significance.  The 2014 and 2019 Godzilla movies (I’ve only seen the first 1/3 or so of the 2019 one..) don’t really do it for me.  I don’t know why they have to fill a giant monster movie with so much uninteresting human drama with really uninteresting characters.  I enjoyed <strong>Shin Godzilla (2016)</strong> much more due to the fact that it focused on the disaster and any drama was a natural effect of the chaos in trying to respond to it.  Anyway, that’s my symposium on giant monster movies.  As for Kong: Skull Island… I actually did like it.  First of all, while there was some character drama wedged in there, most of the characters were much more likable and the cast was great.  I like anything with John Goodman and the highlight of the movie is John C Reilly.  The actual plot and story is not too far off from the original King Kong.  Traveling to an island, revealing King Kong, King Kong fighting other monsters on the island.  So in that way, it’s like an updated version of the original, although this one ends up being more about escaping the island rather than capturing him.  I also liked that this took place in the Vietnam war era.. it doesn’t change too much in the story, but it makes the soundtrack better (Black Sabbath and two Creedence songs and neither of them were Fortunate Son, huh).  Well anyway, I’m rambling now, but one last thing.. the creatures all looked pretty good to me, the CGI seemed pretty well done.. it made King Kong seem believable as a giant gorilla.

      "Why randomly the 5th movie in the Harry Potter series, you might ask.  I bought an 8-film blu-ray set on eBay for cheaper than I saw it on Amazon thinking I got a good deal.  However, the discs all seem very.. different, no real consistency and there was a duplicate copy of the 4th film instead of the 5th.  So I’m thinking it’s a bootleg.. the dark spot of my movie collection.  Shame!  Shame!  Anyway, so I ended up seeing all but the Order of the Phoenix and bought it individually used later on.  So finally I’ve completed the Harry Potter journey.  I’m not really a Harry Potter guy.. I’m a <strong>Lord of the Rings </strong>trilogy man myself.  I didn’t grow up with either, so I don’t really have nostalgia either way.  I just prefer something a little less kid-oriented with a premise that feels a bit more universal.. I feel I can relate more to a hobbit on a journey to complete a quest than a kid who becomes a wizard.  Anyway, all that to say the Harry Potter movies are solid movies, but I lack that attachment that many people have who read the books or saw the movies when they were younger.  The middle films suffer the most for me.. not as fun and imaginative as the first ones and not as significant as the last ones.  I skipped from the 4th to 6th and, aside from a few key moments, I wouldn’t have even known there was a 5th movie between those two.  Still, I don’t dislike the movie.. the effects and settings are always great and it is a fun and creative world, but the plot and the characters don’t quite grab me",

Where they differed was that I enjoyed the Superman story more, but the effects were pretty dated.. while with Clash of the Titans, I wasn’t as interested in the story and, though some effects were dated, the stop-motion and creatures were pretty cool.  So it kind of balanced out.  One cool thing that Clash of the Titans had was a golden owl helper.. C3POwl.

It’s a fun movie (fitting for the “Fun” Adventures category), but it does take a while to get going.  There is a lot of backstory and setup when I was just waiting to see the actual Superman stuff.  Once it gets to actual Superman mode, it’s fun.. but also very cartoonish (ok yeah I know, it’s a comic after all).  The villain and his bumbling sidekick, the cheesy Superman lines and the overly ridiculous powers all feel like those old 60s/70s cartoons in live action form.

What I liked about the original (and a reason I like the OG <strong>Seven Samurai (1954)</strong>) is because the variety of characters.  How they are introduced, their specific skills and traits and their individual journey throughout the movie.  In The Magnificent Seven Ride, I didn’t get that so much.  It’s really more of a <strong>Dirty Dozen (1967)</strong> type of movie.  A group of prisoners have a chance to fight for their freedom, but with low odds of surviving.

      "I said before that I like Clint Eastwood westerns where he is more “mysterious” and more of the strong, silent type.  But somehow, I didn’t quite like this one as much as the previous.  It’s a pretty simple premise.. he is a prisoner that has value as a hunter so he is hired to help hunt someone.  The rest of the movie is pretty much that pursuit.  I guess where it falls flat for me is that it feels kind of.. basic.  Maybe unoriginal.  It’s still fun and not bad, but there’s nothing about it that really separates it from any other movie with a similar plot.  It’s still not bad, but just a little “empty” if that makes any sense.",

      "Next up is a Clint Eastwood western I hadn’t seen.  I’m used to him as the silent, mysterious type, but in this one, he is a little more talkative and, of course, there is a bit more character relationship than his other westerns.  I tend to prefer the mysterious type a bit better, but this style had some good moments.  It’s basically a “buddy” movie, sort of like a buddy cop movie, where the two of them have to work together to make it to their destination.  Clint Eastwood’s character is on his way to some French garrison basically out of a chance to make money and he rescues Sister Sara and helps her get there too, since she is heading that direction anyway.  It’s fun overall, but I don’t really need the relationship aspect in my old westerns.. just personal preference.",

      "Or <strong>Sartana the Gravedigger</strong> in some circles.  It was kind of confusing to figure out which movie is which among the Sartana series, especially with alternate titles.  This one was pretty fun.  The premise is that “Sartana” and a gang rob a bank for $300,000 and a $10,000 bounty is put on his head, causing several people to come after him, seeking the bounty.  Why I use quotes around “Sartana” is because it was not actually him, but someone pretending to be him.   The real Sartana doesn’t like that very much and goes on a hunt to find out who did it.  It’s a good premise since it gives you an excuse to go from place to place, gunfighting and what not.. but also a little bit of that investigation/mystery feel.  Because of the time it was made and the fact that it’s Italian, I got some giallo vibes from it.  All in all, a fun movie, but I still can’t get over the fact that Sartana is just <em>too</em> powerful, so there is never a lot of suspense about whether he’ll survive.  He wins every fight easily without a struggle.  The movie is a little cartoon-ish in that way and some of the things he does, but I guess that’s part of the fun.",

      "Here we go with Old Western #1.  Of course, this happens to be the longest movie on the watchlist, clocking in at almost three and a half hours (!).  I like epic movies sometimes, but I was hoping to ease into the longer ones this watchlist.  But it’s all right, I liked the movie.  It really felt like<strong> Gone With the Wind (1939)</strong> but with a Texas ranch as the backdrop.. and also the main characters don’t seem to hate each other so much.  Like Gone With the Wind, time passes pretty quick in the movie.. from just meeting each other, to getting married, to having kids, the kids growing, etc.  While it is a Western in the geographical sense, it really doesn’t “feel” much like a classic western.  It’s more like 1920-1950 range.. cars, planes, all that.  Even though it wasn’t quite what I expected of a western, the movie was still entertaining throughout and it was nice to see a relationship that’s a little more realistic and not too sugar-coated.  Also, this is the first James Dean movie I’ve watched and his character was.. ok.  I felt like he could have been fleshed out more.  All in all though, good movie and a good option for one of those old Hollywood epics.",

It starts with the execution of a criminal, then shows a bunch of college students partying at some beach resort.  Of course people are getting killed here and there and the main guy and girl take on the investigation.  Nothing you haven’t seen before.

Also, the whole giallo aspect of the movie is great, especially having watched a few these past weeks.

Unfortunately, maybe due to my heightened expectations, this one didn’t quite live up to the trend.  It was still good though.  I liked the cold, isolated station.. very similar to <strong>The Thing (1982)</strong>.  Like that movie, it has some internal conflicts here and there and there’s a psychological/paranoia element to it.  But this one has a much less defined “struggle”, if that’s the right term.  In The Thing, it’s clear what is happening and it gives meaning and impact to everything that happens.  In The Last Winter, it’s more of a mysterious “something” out in the snow.  Maybe it’s a personal preference, but I like the clearer idea of what’s happening.  The cast is pretty good, some recognizable faces, but there’s some pretty cheesy CGI that kind of ruins the mood.  I still like the setting and the overall feel of the movie, and this was definitely a little more activity than the previous Fessenden films, but it didn’t <em>quite</em> reach the heights I hoped for.  Still one of the better movies from this watchlist/tournament thing.",

However, this movie has a surprisingly good cast with a lot of recognizable actors.  The basic premise is that a ship crew heads out to find some crashed/lost ship, where they see visions and g-g-ghoosts.  It’s got that typical crew banter relationship (like <strong>Alien (1979)</strong>, <strong>Aliens (1986)</strong> or some movies I watched in my first watchlist, <strong>Leviathan (1989) </strong>is a good example).  Actually, even though the major aspects of the movies are not so similar, this kind of reminded me of Leviathan but made in a different era.  Instead of infectious creatures in Leviathan, its ghosts here.  Anyway, that’s a bit of a tangent.. the movie is not so interesting, even with some twists here and there.

This is the third in kind of a loose trilogy with those two and it’s just… eh.  The gore is fine, but the premise seems a little unoriginal.  <strong>A</strong> <strong>Bucket of Blood (1959)</strong> already did something pretty similar, for example.  The movie just kind of stretches that premise for a while and it really drags and it kind of turns into a 60s beach teenager style movie for a while.

What I find about certain types of movies.. giallos, classic Universal, Hammer especially… is that I have a kind of range that most movies will fall into.  For example, most Universal movies, for me, will fall into the 5-7 range, Hammer would be 6-7 and giallo movies will be around that same range.  I guess it’s because each one has a specific formula and feel, so it’s just the details that make any difference.  For this giallo, it follows the template, but it’s in a cozier location, some kind of bed and breakfast place in the woods.  Otherwise, it’s all the same giallo tropes so it ends up being ok and I will probably forget about except the setting.. and the unusual amount of bare old man asses.

This one does a good job of making the phantom a tragic character that you sympathize with, mainly because that opera owner guy is such a bastard.  The sets, the colors, the style is all very Hammer, so that’s good.  A personal drawback for me with these movies is just.. I’m not an opera guy.  It’s hard to finally get that off my chest… but there it is.  Musicals (movies, stage plays, operas, anything) are just not my cup of tea.  In this movie, the musical aspect is minimal enough to not feel like I’m watching a full-fledged musical, but there are a few scenes.

I guess in the end, I’ll have to trust the numbers and go with <strong>Wendigo</strong>, even though, months or years from now, I may end up finding that I prefer Serial Mom more.. but Wendigo just stuck with me more.

It’s not the BEST movie ever or anything, but it’s really entertaining.  As the title implies, it’s about a mom who is a serial killer.  In my head, I expected it to be about a mom who gradually goes from normal to crazy.. but she is pretty much crazy from the start.  It’s more fun this way, especially with how good Kathleen Turner plays the mom.  The big plus for me in this movie is its setting.. mid-90s suburban town.

Oddly enough, this is fourth whodunit murder mystery in a row in this watchlist with a reveal at the end.  I expected it of the slashers and the giallos, sure, but not so much Universal and H.G. Lewis.  The gore here is about what I’ve come to expect with these movies, although it seems like there is a little bit less of it this time.  The tone is pretty goofy and there are about a million times a woman walks into a room where another had just been killed and then screams when she sees what happened.  It gets pretty ridiculous.  The main guy is overly cool and calm, maybe he is supposed to be a parody.

      "Finally its March.. and I’m already at movie #21 of 32.. maybe I could have done a full 64 bracket between February/March.  But that’d be over a movie a day for two months.  Anyway, there are a lot of movies called <strong>The Black Cat</strong> and they all seem to have different plots.  From those that I’ve seen, I think the Dario Argento segment from <strong>Two Evil Eyes (1990)</strong> is fundamentally closer to the original Poe story, though modernized.  This one is more of a murder mystery in a mansion style of movie, which is always fun.  It had potential but it’s a little goofy at times (another one of these butler/servant comedic relief characters).  All in all, it’s got the atmosphere and the setup, but it’s only ok on the execution.  Also, there is just a bit of Bela Lugosi, but not much so don’t expect too much there.",

By that I mean, it’s not some epic scope, across the country and through cities.. it’s mostly in a single location or two.  I really liked the opening, someone getting stranded due to a car breakdown, it’s storming out, she has to stay the night in some small little inn/restaurant.  Really good mood.

I originally bought the Scream Factory set as more of a completionist thing, but now I’m glad I did.  So far, every movie on there has been at least “pretty good” in my book, and this one was even better.  It’s actually a very “quiet” movie (slow, but not boring), but it hits a lot of the things I like: snow, isolation, small town vibe and subtlety.  The cast is good (cmon, Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle!) and everything is played out in a really subdued, realistic way.  The premise is simple.. a family with one kid is on their way to some snowy retreat when they hit a deer in the road which was being hunted and one of the hunter is kind of pissed off about it.  From there, it’s more drama than horror, but for someone who isn’t expecting a monster fest (the title IS Wendigo..) and can accept something slower paced, it’s pretty great",

There are a couple late 90s actors as well with Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Shannon and it has some goofy CGI here and there.  The main thing that I really didn’t like about this movie was the editing.. so many cuts and quick flashes of ghosts.. I just want to SEE the things, not these little 0.5 second flashes.

I’ve seen the BBC miniseries of the Agatha Christie story, so I’m only familiar with the original through that, but I preferred that format more.

Aren’t woodsy slashers one of the most “summery” things out there?  In the world of slasher-in-the-woods, there is of course the <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> series and I have a soft spot for <strong>Sleepaway Camp (1983)</strong>.  <strong>The Burning (1981)</strong> is good and <strong>Madman (1981)</strong> is.. all right.  Below those is <strong>The Prey (1983)</strong> that I just watched in the first round of this March Madness.  And below that is <strong>Don’t Go in the Woods</strong>.  Why doesn’t it live up to the others?  Well its production quality is pretty low, even by 80s slasher standards, the characters have whatever the opposite of charisma is and the kills are pretty lame.  I’m sure a lot of it comes down to budget.. the kills are generally off-screen with just a splash of bright red blood after the fact.  There isn’t much else to this movie, just a few campers hiking in the wilderness and people go missing and the park rangers have to go investigate.  As an aside, I really prefer the slashers-in-the-woods that are based around campgrounds and cabins.  There’s something interesting about the contrast between the fun, cozy cabins and the threat of the killer.  Anyway, enough of my rambling, I guess because I didn’t watch and write about a movie for over a week, I couldn’t help myself.. although I barely talked about <em>this </em>particular movie at all.. and it makes sense, it’s not a very significant or memorable one.",

      "Stop!  Hammer time.  I’ve seen a few Hammer films over the years and none have really stood out to me.  I dig the settings though, they are good for that Halloweentime atmosphere.  In this one, you don’t have THE Dracula, so, similar to <strong>Dracula’s Daughter</strong>, it just didn’t feel like it was a Dracula movie.  Although, there was Peter Cushing as Van Helsing to help connect it.  As a latecomer to old Universal and Hammer, I feel I just don’t “get” the movies like many horror fans do.  But that’s not to say I dislike them, they are solid just for the atmosphere alone.  I guess it’s just that, the older the movie, the farther away it is for me and it’s just harder to relate.",

I was expecting something a lot more horrific, maybe cheap effects and trashy fun, but this was a lot more “artsy” than I anticipated.  The premise is a couple moves out to the country for a while, trying to have a baby but can’t, the husband’s a scientist really devoted to his work and the wife is an artist.  The beginning felt like a Stephen King adaptation for some reason.  The rest of the movie is mostly a relationship drama with some horrific elements worked in, but really not much.  Some scenes with animals definitely made me more uncomfortable than horror movies generally do, so it was not an easy watch.  Also, the music was surprisingly beautiful.  In the end, I didn’t get what I was expecting at all, but as a more artsy drama with a bit of horror, it was pretty good.",

      "I wanted to make sure I got this one in early since Valentine’s Day is coming up in a little over a week so I put it in the first group of 8 movies and I won’t be able to watch any for about a week when I’m out of town trying (and failing) to ski.  I’ve watched it now, so mission accomplished.  It’s a slasher that definitely was riding the wave of the post-<strong>Scream (1996)</strong> era of slashers.  It sticks to the formula pretty well.. there’s a past incident that leads to the present-day slashings, the identity of the killer is kept a mystery and the killer wears a mask, although it’s a <em>little</em> goofy.  However, for 80s slashers fans, they’d be disappointed that there is basically no gore effects or senseless nudity… but it’s a different era.  The characters are fine, some a little unlikeable, but not too memorable, especially the final girl, if you want to call her that.  In the end, it’s a good enough early 2000s slasher and it’s a rare holiday-themed horror movie that isn’t Christmas or Halloween.",

      "Well… this is an interesting watch in 2021.  The maniacs here are a bunch of Confederate-flag-waving southerners who lure a group of victims into their small town to kill them in elaborate and bloody ways.  They do this as some kind of 100 year anniversary/ritual related to the end of the US Civil War.  Maybe a sequel in 2065..?  Despite its cheap appearance, it’s actually not a bad movie.  Of course, being an HG Lewis movie, it’s gorey, especially for the early part of the 1960s.  The maniacs were pretty creepy in their own way, “friendly” the whole time.  It’s a movie worth watching even almost 60 years later..

This is the first movie of the watchlist and it was technically released in 1983 but I read that it was actually filmed in 1979/1980, which is funny because it has an obvious similarity to <strong>Friday the 13th (1980)</strong> and other slashers in the woods, but this was made before the slasher trend took off.  You’ve got a monstrous killer who was affected by some decades-earlier tragedy.. people are picked off one-at-a-time and there is some decent gore.  So as far as slashers go, this is all right, but with that comes the standard uninteresting characters, some…ok… acting and some awkward shots, like there was some slow-motion part that I found pretty funny.  Also, the killer seems to kind of “roar”..?  Oh and I found the music in here really similar to some of the music from <strong>The Shining (1980)</strong>… probably coincidence.

The action parts are fairly short and not very dramatic (ok, maybe the ending sequence..)  Really the story is more drama, focusing on the main character and his girlfriend and son.  It’s a little slow at first but it’s interesting to see this family as they move from place to place and bond a little.

The plot is a little weird.. basically female virgins are being attacked/raped by some creature and a detective and doctor are trying to figure out what’s going on.  That’s basically it.

I’d prefer the old-fashioned way but.. oh well.  I’m guessing this movie was trying piggyback off of <strong>The Fly (1958)</strong>, but instead of a scientist turning into a fly, it’s a businesswoman turning into a wasp.  However, if you are hoping for a wasp woman, skip to the last 3 minutes of the movie and you’ve basically seen it all… the rest of the movie is just.. nothingness.  A void.  Well, not really, but it’s just a lot of uninteresting talk about a scientist that many don’t trust and a discovery he makes that helps the businesswoman look younger.. but I guess you can imagine what happens.

I would say it’s not <em>good</em>.. but I would take a monster movie over another supernatural ghost movie any day.  The monster is I guess supposed to be the abominable snowman creature?  Though, it’s really more like bigfoot and I don’t recall there being any snow.. Lloyd Braun is a guy who is wheelchair-bound and watches a group of vacationing girls through the window.  Basically, take <strong>Rear Window (1954)</strong> but with Lloyd Braun, add the girls trip element of <strong>The Descent (2005)</strong>, but if the girls were more annoying and worse actresses and add in a bigfoot type creature and basically that’s the movie.  There are also a couple really small roles for some horror icons.. Dee Wallace, Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen, so it definitely seems like it’s made by horror fans and not just a cheap cash-in.

I guess because I always heard a lot about those and never heard much about the others, so I just ignored them.  But I do have the VHS tapes for this and <strong>Alien Resurrection (1997)</strong>, so someday I’ll get around to that one.  Anyway, enough of my Alien viewing history.  Alien 3 is basically all right.  It’s not as timeless as <strong>Alien</strong> and the action and characters aren’t as good as <strong>Aliens</strong>.  It’s a pretty dreary movie, taking place on some prison colony in space and, yeah, that orange-yellow tint gets kind of old.  Some characters are kind of over-the-top, some are too serious but nothing too bad.  There’s a little bit of CGI/green screening effects that don’t hold up well.. but in the end, it works pretty well as a kind of conclusion to the first two movies.  In that sense, the first three Alien movies make a pretty decent trilogy and you could just end it right there.  I do know that <strong>Alien Resurrection</strong> kind of.. messes that up, but I think of it a bit like the Halloween series.  You could watch <strong>Halloween (1978), Halloween 2 (1981)</strong> and <strong>Halloween: H20 (1998)</strong> and call that the Laurie Strode trilogy.  But.. if you have to… you can go onto <strong>Halloween: Resurrection (2002)</strong>.. also “Resurrection”.. huh.

      "Starting the “randomizer” watchlist with a Stephen King adaptation.  This might have fit into my “Stephen King Non-Horror” theme from a few weeks ago since it’s not really horror, more of a suspense.  This is one of those rare cases where I had actually already read the source material before seeing the movie and I think that kind of hinders the viewing experience.  The premise is an interesting one and the cast is pretty decent, but it’s not really a story that needs to be a full-length movie.  I’m sure I’ve complained about this several times in other Stephen King short story adaptations but.. I’m doing it again anyway.  It’s an easy enough watch though and they didn’t do anything too egregious with the adaptation.  I was worried that it would have some younger married couple as the main characters to appeal to a younger audience, which would kind of ruin the whole point of the story.. but luckily, they stuck to the story.

If it’s the last one they ever make, then it’s a pretty decent farewell since it’s kind of a modern-day throwback to those old kid-centric movies.  For that reason though, it’s not really my style, but it is better than the old ones.  Unfortunately, in this one, the “new Gamera” is still a growing turtle, so he looks pretty goofy.  The enemy monster looks pretty cool, kind of a dragon with a spiny back (but the CGI of its “tongue” was distracting).  I would have really liked to see what a more matured/advanced Gamera would look like in a post-2000 movie but.. oh well.

Higher than any of the previous Gamera movies, for that matter.. but even then, the movie as a whole is just “good”, but if they could have combined some of the stuff from the other two 90s Gamera movies with the ending of this one, I think there’d be a great movie in there somewhere.  The enemy monster design was pretty cool and looked like something from Final Fantasy, although the late 90s CGI dated it a bit in some places.

      "I really don’t have much to say about this other than it’s really similar to the previous movie in a lot of ways, mainly the tone.  The monster effects are similar and there are some decent fight scenes with the villain monster, but sometimes the “monster physics” (not sure how to describe that) look funny.  Like.. the speed of the monsters movement doesn’t quite give the impression that they are these giant monsters?  I don’t now, but anyway, again it fits my style a bit more since it’s treated like a serious emergency.  There is also a surprisingly bloody kill in a subway tunnel.  But yeah, more of the same from the previous one, which is all right for me.",

      "Finally, we’re out of the “old” Gamera movies and into the “new” (if you consider 25 years old as being new..).  Definitely a step up from the others, but the monsters still look a little funny, but closer to realistic.  I prefer the more serious approach to a monster movie, treating it like a real disaster, so this one is better for my preferences.  This movie has things like like emergency news bulletins, city evacuations, etc.  Anyway, I’m curious to see the next three Gamera movies.  Also, little side note, if my math is correct, this is the 100th movie I’ve logged since starting this blog in late August (2020).  What a ride… time to keep going!",

      "So it’s come to this:  A Gamera clip show.  Basically, that’s all this is.  After watching seven the preceding seven Gamera movies within a few weeks of watching this, it makes it much worse since I’m just watching a lot of old footage that I <em>just</em> saw.  I’ve run into something similar before with <strong>Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2 (1987)</strong>, where half of the movie is just flashbacks to the first movie.  However, the non-flashback part of that movie gave us “Garbage daaay!” so.. how can I hate it.  In this movie, there is some typical alien girls subplot with a typical little kid who summons Gamera.  Then they watch Gamera fight all the old monsters, which is just old footage repurposed as if they were new fights.  Pretty lame.  Anyway, I guess for someone who doesn’t want to watch seven Gamera movies, they could just watch this one and call it good.. but then they’d miss out on the Gamera song.  This one has the “Gamera March” in its place and it’s not as memorable.  So, not really a good movie but it’s ok as a summary or clip show.",

      "Not to spoil the ending, but Gamera plays the enemy monster’s spinal fins like a xylophone and plays part of his own theme song and then dances.. has Godzilla ever done that?  Case closed.  Anyway, this movie is about as bad as that sounds.  The kids in this are somehow even more annoying than the others, maybe because they are too young so their “acting” is worse.  Also, the alien woman has to be the clumsiest alien I’ve ever seen in a movie.  There is a bit of fighting between the two monsters, but nothing really spectacular.  This time it’s an underwater monster, so a lot of their interactions are in the water so it’s kind of limited on what they can do.  Zigra looks a little better than some of those other dumb monsters but..still not very cool.  All in all, probably my least favorite Gamera movie so far just because it’s kind of embarrassingly bad at some points.  Looks like this is the last of the “original” Gamera movies.  They released seven of them, one per year over seven years.  Next up is one from 1980, so I’ll be curious to see if there is a shift in the style.  I hope so..",

      "“You’re so cool, Gamera! You’re so cool, Gamera!”  Well, I think, by now, I know what I’m getting every time I watch a Gamera movie.  Although, at least this one spent a little more time with the city’s response to the monsters and a <em>little</em> less on the kids, so that’s a positive.  Also, it seemed like there was more monster fighting here than the previous couple, but maybe that’s just my imagination.  Jiger, which is basically some triceratops creature, is not a very well-designed creature.. but it’s one of the more destructive monsters in the series, so at least it’s more of a threat.  Aside from the cheesy effects, the movie isn’t so bad but I’m a little bit tired of the “we adults need to base our life-or-death choices based on what these kids say” thing.  But it’s an improvement over the previous couple movies and, at halfway through the series, I needed a little bit of a change in the positive direction..",

A couple of kids get in a vehicle they shouldn’t, ultimately end up aboard some spaceship or base and Gamera has to come and save the day.  I will say, I don’t think these kids yelled “Gamera!  Gamera!” quite so much, but the Gamera theme song was used a couple times..  “You’re so strong Gamera!”  As far as Guiron the monster goes, it’s a crawling reptile with a giant knife on its head.  I think they were intentionally making the monsters look dumb at this point.  Anyway, I’m ready for a change in the formula.  My understanding is that the “newer” (still like 20+ years old by now) Gamera films are actually decent, but I won’t get there for a few more movies so… I’ll just wait patiently.",

It’s basically the misadventures of two boy scouts who somehow know and can do things that adults can’t.. it just happens that their misadventures cross paths with Gamera and some bumblebee alien ship thing that is trying to adbuct/control Gamera or something.  Anyway, Viras appears near the end and it’s another dumb-looking monster, even worse than Gyaos to me.  I’m curious who designed these monsters and what grade they were in.  They really look like someone took some kid’s drawings of monsters and literally transformed them into puppets.  Also, there’s <em>even more</em> “Gamera! Gamera!” yelling from the kids.  Only four movies in an that’s already wearing me out.

Watching these after having watched the first 5 or so Godzilla movies really makes this all feel too familiar.  But at least this one had a monster for Gamera to fight.  Also, Barugon can freeze things, which is kind of nice since it seems like most monsters tend to just spit fire.  All in all, the monster fight was a plus but I was less excited watching the first half with some guys looking for a treasure (they goofed up since that lead to Barugon hatching), so it ends up being roughly the same overall rating from me.",

It kind of reminded me of <strong>Godzilla Rides Again (1955)</strong> in terms of its pacing and the fact that it wasn’t really eventful, aside from a few scenes of Gamera running around destroying stuff.  Ok, maybe not “running”.. he’s a giant turtle, which is kind of a strange choice for a giant monster.

There’s a little bit of a <strong>Halloween III (1982)</strong> vibe in the movie.

I don’t remember it being Christmas-themed at all, so I thought maybe for part 4 they got back to basics but no, not at all.  It’s annoying that they even advertised it as such.  When the movie started, Clint Howard was pumped that he found a half-eaten hamburger and so I thought this was going places.  In the end, the movie is more of a cult movie with about 3 minutes of small Christmas decorations in the background and Clint Howard watching some kind of pseudo-Silent Night Deadly Night movie on TV.

Basically, some killer was executed years ago, his spirit can “escape” the cemetery each anniversary of his execution and if someone doesn’t hold their breath driving by the cemetery, guess what.  And how did I put all that together?  Thanks to the guy who worked at the prison or whatever place who just somehow knew it and laid out the exposition very plainly.  Thanks, guy.  Anyway, if it weren’t for some very horrible dialogue and “jokes” between the main friends as well as their bad acting.. it would have been just an “average” movie with nowhere near the bad reputation the Letterboxd ratings have given it.

A little bit of coming-of-age, like the <strong>It</strong> miniseries/movies or <strong>Stand By Me</strong>, but with some tie-in to the Stephen King universe and the Dark Tower books.  I enjoyed the movie for those elements and because of the cast.  It was bittersweet to see such a little Anton Yelchin playing the lead role and he was pretty good.

      "Onto a new theme: non-horror movies based on Stephen King stories.  Some of my favorite movies of all time fall under this category. <strong>Stand By Me (1986)</strong>, <strong>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</strong>, and <strong>The Green Mile (1999)</strong>.  Of course, I like a lot of the horror movies made based on his work, but with horror in general, the quality is pretty hit-or-miss.  Anyway, I have a lot of (almost all of?  Minus sequels, etc) Stephen King movies on blu-ray, DVD and VHS, but I could only find three that I hadn’t seen that looked like they weren’t really horror at all and Dolores Claiborne is the earliest of those.  This is one that has no supernatural element at all.. it’s just a straight drama about a older mother accused of killing a woman for whom she had been a live-in caregiver (hey I used ‘whom’ correctly I think) and her adult journalist daughter who comes back home to find out what happened and try to help her out against the investigators.  It’s not too complicated but still ends up over 2 hours long, but that’s mostly because there are several flashbacks.  In the end, it’s pretty good if a bit slow sometimes.  The cast is the main reason I enjoyed it, especially Kathy Bates.  And of course, Mainer accents.  It’s a good movie if you like family drama.",

      "Pretty dark and weird, which isn’t bad but.. there are definitely some awkward parts if you are watching with anyone else.  Aside from going pretty wild sometimes, there isn’t too much that sticks out for me.  Story-wise, it’s kind of a typical police officer fighting a gang leader.  But the real reason to watch is just for the atmosphere, the characters and the locations.  One notable thing about this release is that they make what could be confusing much more understandable by differentiating the subtitles when speaking different languages (ie “This sentence” vs “[This sentence]” vs “{This sentence}” all represent a different language being spoken).  It has some significance so I’m glad it was done that way, it made it easy for a dumb American like me.",

      "Onto a new theme, Japanese Action movies.  The first one the second in a series in which I’ve only seen the first movie.  I’m not sure what a Gangster VIP is but.. sure.  Anyway, this is an interesting transition from the Western theme because this movie feels so much like a Western that just happens to take place in 1950s Japan.  The main character is basically the same:  an unusually skilled fighter in a kind of one-vs-many scenario, except he uses a knife instead of guns.  The “Gangster” part of the title is that he was in the mafia, the “Outlaw” part I guess is because he tried to get out of that life but still has to fight and pay debts.  The “VIP” part..?  Anyway, this has the same entertainment value as something like <strong>Sartana</strong>, but the knife fights are sort of clumsy and less impressive than gunfights.  I can’t get over the trope (Kung Fu movies do this too) where the bad guys just go after him one at a time and the others patiently wait.  It’s a little awkward here.. they could have killed him easily.. many times… anyway, still a good watch.",

      "I like movies with short succinct titles like this.  Of course, it’s a spaghetti western, which is probably why the title is a paragraph in itself.  Being a spaghetti western, it’s a lot different than the two westerns I watched before this.  Those are old Hollywood epics and this is dirtier and morally gray.  It’s a much smaller story about stealing gold and stealing the stolen gold and justice and blah blah.  After the <strong>Dollars</strong> trilogy and <strong>Django (1966)</strong>, I guess this isn’t really anything new.  Although I think they take it to the extreme in how good of a gunman Sartana is.  Like, yeah, I get it, he is supposed to be good but he is a little <em>too</em> unbelievably fast and accurate.  But just for watching a nearly invincible gunman fight bandits, this is pretty much all I could expect.",

Also, there are a lot of notable actors in it.. but like <strong>The Alamo</strong>, it has that old Hollywood “shine” on it to make everything look a little too clean.  I know it’s just the time it was made and for what it is (a old-style western/epic) it’s enjoyable.  I generally like films with a format that spans a long period of time, checking in every few years.. so this gets points for that, but overall I think the idea could be done better, especially in a more “realistic” way, not something so clean-cut.",

I’m not as into those old “fun” westerns before the Spaghetti western era, except I do really like <strong>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</strong>.  All that to say, The Alamo falls into that latter category.. a little bit too “heroic” and the good guys a little too good.  But even still, the characters were really enjoyable and it is fun.  Also, to be fair, I had issues with the disc so I missed a few chapters in the middle, so maybe I missed a few things.  Overall though, I still enjoyed the movie and might look into getting a blu-ray copy of this, if one exists, since this is a DVD that came in a giant collection of United Artists films.

Though he wasn’t a major part of this movie.. it’s funny that so far 5 out of 6 movies in this watchlist have been either De Niro or Sean Bean.  “Funny” in an “only I find it interesting” kind of way.  Anyway, this movie is all right, especially if you are into those European crime/heist movies with lots of twists and turns and double crosses.  It’s fairly solid in that respect, but for some reason, there is a kind of “flatness” to it.. something about the characters and the interactions.

      "The new theme on the block: Arrow Crime.  I have a lot of movies released by Arrow films since they specialize in 70s/80s horror and action.  Right up my alley, but that means I have a big backlog to get through.  So this theme will help me get through three of them.  The first one, <strong>Cruising</strong>, is one I’d never heard of until Arrow released it.  I can kind of see why it didn’t become a big classic given it’s focus around a controversial community.. the heavy leather and S&amp;M gay scene.  These guys are wild!  I don’t know if these clubs are like that in real life but man.. it’s wild.  Anyway, the movie is a murder mystery within that scene with Al Pacino as an undercover cop.  It’s a good movie but I felt like some things were missing and, based on what I read after, that’s true.  Sounds like a lot of footage had to be cut and permanently destroyed.  Despite Pacino being the main character and having plenty of screen-time, I felt like it might have been nice to “know” his character more.  Anyway, the movie could have been better with extra footage to make some things make a bit more sense, but even still, it was pretty good.  My favorite part was the interrogation “intimidator”.. or whatever he was.  “Who is that guy??”",

Although this had some outside-the-box kind of stuff, like the play and just the general direction the movie went.  But it’s entertaining and still feels relevant.. and I can definitely see the early stages of Travis Bickle from <strong>Taxi Driver (1976)</strong> with De Niro here.  I always thought <strong>Taxi Driver</strong> and <strong>The King of Comedy (1982)</strong> seemed connected, almost like as if Travis Bickle tried to become a comedian but was still a little..unstable.  In that “universe”, I think <strong>Hi, Mom!</strong> could be a kind of prequel to those events.

I know it’s a low budget amateur film, but filmed around the time that <strong>Night of the Living Dead (1968) </strong>was filmed, this just doesn’t maintain my interest like that one does.

The first one is <strong>Greetings</strong>.  The best way I can describe it is sort of like an anthology of loosely connected scenes.  Things are somewhat connected through a “computer dating” story, which is pretty funny for the 60s.. While the comedy isn’t always that great to me, the movie is more interesting just for the era it’s made.  Things like Vietnam draft-dodging and the JFK conspiracy theories (which was probably the most entertaining part to me).

Normally, I would probably dislike something like this (from my experience with another comedy attempt like <strong>The Invisible Woman</strong>), but this has a list of horror stars who are good comedic actors too.

Fewer than that, they just linger too long and more than that are too short to get into anything before it’s over.  Twice Told Tales falls in the “fewer” category with three stories, which is not so bad in itself, but the movie is two hours, so that’s roughly 40 minutes per segment on average.  I liked the first segment the best with two older men finding a kind of youth elixir.  The second segment was a “forbidden love” type situation which had an interesting premise but dragged too much.  The final one is the House of the Seven Gables.  Great setting and everything, but again, just a bit too slow.

Fulci’s <strong>Zombie (1979)</strong> is good and <strong>Dawn of the Dead (1978)</strong> is my favorite horror movie of all time.  So slow, shuffling zombies are right up my alley and as soon as I saw the zombies in this movie, I was ready to go.  They move slow, they look decayed and gross.. that part is awesome.  But do you know who moves slower than the zombies?  The characters in the movie.  It gets a little old seeing people just stand there and gasp and not move while zombies slowly creep in.  So there was a lot of potential here if the characters were just interesting and acted like normal human beings would act.  That’s the whole point of zombie movies to me.. you have to be smart, act quickly and learn to survive, but even then, you still may be overrun.  George Romero’s movies are so good at that, but many others, including this movie, just don’t hit that note for me.  Anyway, thanks for coming to my Dead Talk.",

      "Stepping out of the 70s this time to an 80s movie made by one of the primary Italian filmmakers, Dario Argento.  It definitely feels like a different decade than the previous movies this week, especially with the awesome soundtrack.. but in other ways, it still has that Italian mystery feel.  Maybe partially due to the “new girl arriving at a European school” premise that <strong>Suspiria (1977)</strong> has.  I could have used a little more Donald Pleasance, but at least his monkey came through in the clutch.

They said they felt they needed to restore those scenes for a “film of this importance”.. anyway, it’s kind of fun to watch it that way, to see a 5-10 second segment of VHS quality video then back to HD, it makes you appreciate how far we’ve come with our technology.",

Like, the <strong>Nightmare on Elm Street</strong> series would flair out in the “supernatural” direction.. <strong>Dressed to Kill (1980) </strong>might be out towards a “thriller” direction.

This one is not like those.. I couldn’t tell you anyone’s name or any real character traits.. they are all basically just setup to be killed.

Shortly, I would actively let it fast-forward a little bit more into the episodes.  By season 6, I think I was just fast-forwarding through the entire episode until something happened.

I would say this is the same kind of movie as something like <strong>Hereditary (2018)</strong> or <strong>The Witch (2015)</strong>.  Like the movies from those filmmakers, it’s really about the build-up and great visuals.

There’s a difference between the “slowness” of this compared to something like <strong>The Rite</strong> that I watched earlier this week.

These aren’t the worst offenders, but they aren’t really likable either.  Maybe I’m just an old man.  Little known fact, I was actually born an old man.  Like I said before, exorcisms and possessions just don’t do it for me, so annoying teens + possession.. this movie never really stood a chance.

It’s strange because <strong>The Exorcist (1973)</strong> is a top 10 horror movie for me, but I’m not really into exorcism movies.  The two prequels to The Exorcist , <strong>Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) </strong>and <strong>Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005)</strong>, were both pretty boring to me.  This was in that same vein but a more interesting setting and Anthony Hopkins.  In the end, I was worried about this week because supernatural horror movies generally don’t do it for me.  Something about them being unrealistic but taking themselves so seriously.  It’s not like other horror genres are that realistic either, but generally they are at least fun.  All that to say, this movie, while not poorly made, just didn’t keep my interest.",

It reminds me a little bit of <strong>Saw (2004)</strong> in that there is the horror story (the elevator) wrapped with the detective trying to figure out what’s going on.  It makes for an interesting suspense movie and it’s mostly well done.  I’m not so much a big fan of the security guard who awkwardly and conveniently seems like he has a PhD in Devilology.  I think really his only purpose is to read exposition.  I wondered, after reading the premise, how people would just “know” there could be a devil in the elevator and I guess this their solution.. he just knows a <em>lot</em> about the devil.  “The devil does this..” and “the devil will do that..”  Anyway, just a little awkward to me, but overall it kept my attention and didn’t get TOO ridiculous.  It could have been a more ridiculous movie and called something like “Devilator”",

For some reason, especially with the cover art, I expected it to be more of a period piece, like a 1600s, 1700s New England ghost story but, it’s not that.  It is set in a New England town but otherwise it’s modern day.  There is a ghost woman, I’ll say that much and, if I had seen this when I was a kid, I’m sure the ghost woman imagery would have been imprinted in my brain.

Anyway, this doesn’t really make much sense in how a guy with half a brain transplant physically transforms between one guy or the other..?  But it’s ok.  It’s another Lugosi + Karloff movie but they don’t really interact or anything so don’t use that a selling point.  Overall, kind of meh but ok.

The effects were probably pretty cool back in the 1930s, mainly the glowing skin and a smoky/fiery death scene near the end.

Maybe it’s because it stars Boris Karloff and he has a fun, loyal sidekick, Petty Louie.

Instead, this largely takes place Where the Streets Have No Name, meaning, some island populated with a native group.  So, not quite what I expected, but it was an interesting enough premise.  Basically, this mad doctor convinces the natives that he has the ability to bring people back to life and therefore becomes revered by them.  That means he has them on his side and power over the island, including the others who shipwrecked there with him.  It’s an ok movie, but I have to deduct a bit because of “Aunt Margaret”.. what an annoying character.

Although none of the movies I watched this week are what I’d consider “good”, he made his movies with the budget and constraints that he had and was able to make them mostly entertaining and somewhat coherent, despite all of the editing and shuffling after filming.

I attribute it to watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 while growing up and trying to rent the funniest bad movies my friends and I could find at the video rental store in high school.  This movie.. is not a good movie.  But it has a <em>little</em> bit of that MST3K comfort food feeling, so I don’t feel too bad afterwards.  I don’t even know how the beginning of the movie relates to any of the rest and I really didn’t expect it to be like this “land of the lost” kind of movie with tribal people on a foreign planet fighting each other in different colored filters.  But the point is to entertain and it mostly did. I particularly liked those little bad dudes flying from the cave walls.  Anyway, I never really know how to “assess” these bad movies.  Objectively it’s like a 2/10, but when they have a bit of heart and fun to them, I give them some credit.  After all, it’s just a movie..",

      "Onto Week 4 and the “theme” is Al Adamson movies.  Who is Al Adamson?  Honestly.. I didn’t even know but I saw a Severin box set that I couldn’t pass up that had basically his whole filmography so.. here we are.  Basically, he directed a lot of b-level (or lower?) genre movies in the 60s and 70s, so I’m buckled in for some cheap exploitation films.  The first is Blood of Dracula’s Castle, which wasn’t as bad as I expected but it was about as cheap as I expected.  Lots of weird edits where I just assume someone got hit or punched but they cut so quickly, I guess to mask the fact that there was no budget for effects?  And one part, some vampires were aging rapidly and turning to dust, but you see them normally, then cut to the reactions of the “non-vampires” people saying “they’re suddenly growing old….now they are just dust!” and then cut back to their clothes just full of dust now.  Of course we would want to see this transformation but, it’s all right, movie, you tried.  Anyway, the plot: a couple goes to a castle of vampires (and some servants) where people are captured and used for blood.  If you are expecting vampires doing vampire things, you’ll be disappointed.  They are just well dressed people drinking “blood” out of wine glasses.  It’s a little slow but it’s watchable.",

First it’s like a normal early 90s action movie, with typical villains and even a lair of bad guys all training together.

Two Evil Eyes is sort of an anthology but with only two segments which is kind of unfortunate.  My understanding is that it was supposed to be more but then only George Romero and Dario Argento stayed with it.  So anyway, if it was a 4-5 movie anthology, these two would make better segments.  Kind of drawn out as they are.  I’d say I preferred the first (Romero) segment over the second (Argento).  It’s a bit zombie-ish but not <em>really</em>.

Here’s an idea: Freddy Krueger, Joanie (without Chachi), the teacher from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Susan’s mom from Seinfeld and Captain Spaulding in space fighting aliens.  You son of a bitch, I’m in.  Of course it’s pretty clearly an Alien rip-off, but it seems like some effort was made.  The environments are pretty cool, even if a little low budget.  It wasn’t great, but it scratches that early 80s sci-fi itch.",

      "This was a bit of a step back compared to <strong>War of the Worlds</strong>.  More dated, the weird semi-love triangle was not my bag and the movie was pretty slow to get started.  A lot of uninteresting characters doing uninteresting things, except for the part where they showed the squid NOT eating the fish.  I wonder why that squid (the actor, not the character) didn’t eat those fish?  Good acting, I guess.  The Ray Harryhausen effects are the only thing notable, and they were fun in a cheesy way, but not a super interesting monster, just a giant squid.  The other movie in this blu-ray 2-pack, <strong>20 Million Miles to Earth (1957)</strong> had a more memorable creature, whatever that thing was.",

      "Here we go, week 1: Sci-Fi.  I wanted to start with a sub-genre that is less “pure” horror and more tangential.  Since the War of the Worlds Criterion release recently came out, this was a good excuse to watch it.  Overall, it’s a pretty good movie given its age.  Looks good, for sure.  The ending was a little abrupt.  I know you’re reading this, Future Me, but just <em>in case</em> someone else is reading it, I won’t spoil it.  I liked that the movie gets going right away, no 30 minutes of setup or anything.  It was interesting seeing the panic and confusion in the early scenes.  Also, my ears perked up at hearing the doctor’s name, Clayton Forrester (hmm..)  Ok, that’s one movie down, ~45 to go..",

      "Well, I’m still sitting here, waiting for my Year Three to begin with <strong>Halloween 2022</strong>.  Still about 10 days away from that.  But in the meantime, I can’t help but look over some of the movies I’ve watched.  I want to keep this blog about the movies I’ve watched as part of watchlists, but I’m realizing that those movies are actually now a significant chunk of the movies I’ve watched all-time.  My estimate in Letterboxd, based on logging all the movies I watch and all the movies I can remember seeing, is 2,235 movies watched in my life.  Of course, I’m sure I’ve missed a lot that I watched years and years ago, but let’s say it’s still less than 2,500.  That means 500 movies for these watchlists is at least 1/5 of all the movies I’ve seen in my lifetime.. crazy!  So I think it’s fair to take some random looks at these as a significant sample size with some “A Few Words About…” posts here and there when I’m bored or am thinking about a certain topic.  So of course, the first one I want to talk about is 80s slashers since that’s a big chunk of these lists.",
      "Again, using Letterboxd, I estimate the number of 80s slashers that I’ve seen to be about <strong>128</strong>.  The number of those that I’ve watched through these watchlists is <strong>51</strong>.  A decent amount but not even half.  All those <strong>Halloween</strong>, <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, <strong>Nightmare on Elm St</strong> movies, of course, were ones I’d already watched years ago.  I want to focus just on some random odds and ends things about the 80s slashers that I’ve seen as part of this blog",
      "<strong>Settings</strong>",
      "One of my favorite things about horror movies in general is where they take place.  In the world of 80s slashers, you get some pretty common ones.. the woods being the prime example.  From my time with slashers in these watchlists, there are a few that stand out to me:",
      "<li><strong>Blood Theatre</strong> – In a movie theater.  Is it a good movie?  Not at all, but I like that as a slasher setting</li><li><strong>The Wind</strong> and <strong>American Gothic</strong> – Both of these have that kind of remote island or sea-side setting that, if it weren’t for all the slashing, seem like they’d be quite cozy</li><li><strong>Bad Dreams</strong> – In a hospital ward.  Maybe not super unique among horror movies, but not so common in slashers</li><li><strong>Effects</strong> and <strong>Destroyer</strong> – On movie sets.  It’s kind of fun to have this movie within a movie setup</li><li><strong>Amsterdamned</strong> – Well..Amsterdam, obviously.  A much larger scale for a slasher, but those canals are pretty cool</li><li><strong>Road Games</strong> – On the road in Australia.  The movie didn’t click with me so much, but it’s definitely a unique setting</li>",
      "Of course there were some in the woods, in small towns, in high schools and colleges, more urban areas.  Those are all good fun too, but I appreciate those movies that take place somewhere a little outside the box",
      "<strong>The Killers</strong>",
      "What is a slasher without the one doing the slashing, right?  I like those strong silent killers like Michael and Jason, of course.  But there are all types.. some slashers make it a mystery in who is doing the killing.. and others are upfront about who it is right from the start.  Some even follow the killer almost as a main character.  Here are a few that stuck out to me:",
      "<li><strong>Don’t Answer the Phone</strong> – This guy was weird man.  But I guess that’s effective because it still stands out to me today</li><li><strong>10 to Midnight</strong> – Another one where the killer is known throughout the movie and is also pretty weird..</li><li><strong>Cemetery of Terror</strong> – Unique in that the killer is a zombie.  I mean, sure there was a zombified Jason eventually, but most slashers were real, living people</li><li><strong>Bloody Birthday</strong> – The killers here are just some kids.  Nothing really threatening or intimidating about it</li><li><strong>Fade to Black</strong> – Another one where we focus on the killer as a main character, but he’s a little more sympathetic in some ways</li>",
      "<strong>The Good Guys</strong>",
      "Well, if we’re talking about the killers, why not the survivors (or.. near survivors).  There is the slasher trope of the final girl, but what also matters to me is the cast of characters trying to survive.  Whether or not they survive doesn’t really matter.. at least they tried.  Here are some where I still remember the cast of characters, so they at least stuck out for better or for worse..",
      "<li><strong>Cutting Class</strong> – I mean, it had Brad Pitt.. how could someone forget about that</li><li><strong>10 to Midnight</strong> – Charles Bronson and his daughter were likeable enough to me</li><li><strong>The Wind</strong> – I have to give credit to Meg Foster here because it’s almost like a one-woman show</li><li><strong>Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker</strong> – These characters stood out more because I ended up seeing this again a few months later as part of the Last Drive-In.  But they stand out too because that aunt is super weird</li>",
      "<strong>Other Memorable Moments</strong>",
      "Not sure how else to describe it, but when I scan through the list of 80s slashers I watched, I’m hit with some specific memories here and there.  I thought it’d be worth just noting a few of those that spring to mind:",
      "<li><strong>Amsterdamned</strong> – I really remember the big boat chase scene.  I’m not usually a vehicle chase guy, but this one was pretty fun</li><li><strong>Psychos in Love</strong> – I didn’t really like this movie, but what really stands out when I think of this movie was the weird “I hate grapes” speech.  I don’t know if it was supposed to be funny or what but.. I still have the memory of thinking “ok I don’t think I’m feeling this movie” at that point</li><li><strong>Wacko</strong> – The main character’s dad in this was suuuper weird</li><li><strong>Moon in Scorpio</strong> – I just remember that this movie seemed to want to take itself seriously with these Vietnam war flashbacks, but they were so cheap and laughable</li><li><strong>Christmas Evil</strong> – I think anyone would remember the ending</li><li><strong>I, Madman</strong> – Even these ~2 years later, I still remember there being a fun stop-motion monster scene</li>",
      "Ok, I think that’s all I have to say about 80s slashers for now.  I still have dozens of owned slashers to watch, so maybe I’ll add more thoughts later.  Now to go back to twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the Halloween watchlist to start",

      "Whoo boy.. finally time to look at EVERYTHING.  500 movies, 18 watchlists, 24(ish) months.  It’s been a ride.  Let’s focus on watchlists first, listing some favorites and some.. not-so-favorites.  This doesn’t really tie to the average ratings per list, but more based on what my fondest memories are (or not as fond memories)",
      "<strong>Top 5 Watchlists</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Halloween 2020</strong> – The first one, so of course it holds a special place.  The 90s horror, the sci-fi horror, my first Al Adamson experiences, for better or worse.  That list still stands out to me.</li><li><strong>March Madness</strong> – A really fun format and an actually decent group of movies.  The Larry Fessenden ones were a pleasant surprise and I dug some of those comedy horrors.  Overall, it was a lot of fun and I like playing the little matchup game</li><li><strong>Days of Listmas</strong> – Another fun structure with a surprisingly decent set of movies.  I got a good mix of slashers, westerns, sci-fi and even a pinch of drama</li><li><strong>Halloween 2021</strong> – Of course I always like Halloween, but this one was a little less memorable.  Some good stuff but not quite at the same level as the first Halloween list</li><li><strong>March Madness 2</strong> – Similarly, same fun structure, but less memorable movies.  I still enjoyed it, of course, but I wish the movie selection was a bit stronger</li>",
      "<strong>Bottom 5 Watchlists</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Gamera</strong> – I liked a few, but 12 of these in a row was a little much</li><li><strong>Randomizer</strong> – I liked the idea, but the movies weren’t great and there was nothing to tie them together</li><li><strong>Backloggin</strong> – Also a fairly random assortment of movies and not particularly strong ones.  But it was useful for clearing out some old backlog items</li><li><strong>Blood!</strong> – There were sub-groups so it had some sense of cohesion, but some movies were just painful to get through</li><li><strong>The Missing Years</strong> – Controversy.  The group of movies were pretty good, but so many old movies in a row was a little draining and, again, there wasn’t a lot of similarity in styles and genres.  I definitely slowed down my pace a lot during this one, just finding it hard to stay motivated</li>",
      "Coincidentally, or not, those top 5 happen to be the five largest watchlists too with <strong>70</strong>, <strong>32</strong>, <strong>36</strong>, <strong>50</strong>, and <strong>32</strong> movies respectively.  I learned that those lists with a mostly random assortment are less memorable to me, but sometimes kind of necessary.  I unfortunately don’t have enough movies to make up enough categories or sub-genres or things like that to tie movies together, so sometimes I just have to bite the bullet and do a list that can knock out a bunch of movies that don’t really fit a category.  But I’ll see what I can do going forward.  I have <strong>Halloween 2022</strong> lined up, I think I have a good themed one for after that and of course I’m going to try to do a <strong>March Madness 3</strong>, but the rest of the year is up for grabs at this point.",
      "<strong>Years</strong>",
      "Just a few notes about years overall:",
      "<li>The king of the years is <strong>1972</strong> with <strong>20</strong> movies out of <strong>500</strong>.  <strong>1988</strong> was a close runner-up with <strong>19</strong></li><li>The biggest three-year span is <strong>1987-1989</strong> with <strong>54</strong> movies total.  That’s almost <strong>11%</strong> of the entire blog from just three years</li><li>Decade-wise, the <strong>80s</strong> decade wins obviously with <strong>131</strong> movies.  That’s over <strong>26%</strong>.  The next closest is the <strong>70s</strong> at <strong>95</strong>.  From the <strong>60s</strong> on, the lowest decade (not counting the <strong>2020s</strong>) is the <strong>2000s</strong> with just <strong>32</strong></li>",
      "<strong>Labels/Formats</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Scream Factory</strong> is of course on top with <strong>107</strong> movies, just beating out <strong>Arrow</strong> with <strong>100</strong> even.  <strong>Arrow</strong> has the slight rating advantage though at <strong>6.25</strong> vs <strong>6.18</strong>.  No other label even comes close with <strong>Severin</strong> being the next highest as <strong>42</strong></li><li><strong>455</strong> Blu Ray, <strong>33</strong> DVD, <strong>12</strong> VHS.  I’m surprised there weren’t more DVD since I mixed those in quite a bit with some genre movies, randomizers and things like that.  But still, nice to have gotten through <strong>455</strong> Blu Rays</li>",
      "<strong>Categories</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Japanese</strong> movies are the highest with <strong>56</strong>, narrowly beating out <strong>80s Slashers</strong> at <strong>51</strong>.  I guess all the <strong>Godzilla</strong>, <strong>Gamera</strong>, and <strong>Tsukamoto</strong> really add up</li><li>Only <strong>19</strong> <strong>Giallo</strong> movies.. somehow I would think there would be more since it’s a common staple of Halloween and March Madness</li>",
      "<strong>Top/Bottom Movies</strong>",
      "Finally time to look at the favorites and least favorites across ALL the movies.  Let’s stick with only a top/bottom 10 to keep these clubs exclusive.. but with some honorable/dishonorable mentions",
      "<strong>Top</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Marriage Story</strong> – The quality of acting and writing is hard to beat</li><li><strong>Glengarry Glen Ross</strong> – Similarly high quality of acting/writing, but a little bit less of a relatable story (I’m no salesman)</li><li><strong>A Dark Song</strong> – Looking forward to rewatching this again sometime.  Maybe it won’t hold up as well but I remember liking it quite a bit</li><li><strong>The Editor</strong> – Another one I need to rewatch, but I remember it was pretty funny for horror/giallo fans</li><li><strong>The Northman</strong> – Has some slight imperfections, but it’s a solid historical adventure/drama</li><li><strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong> – Sometimes abstract, sometimes a very serious drama, but it all adds up to an interesting experience for me</li><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – I’m still not sure if I liked this movie <em>that</em> much or if my mood and the weather outside were just the perfect combo at the time.  Maybe I’ll do a re-watch this winter and find out</li><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – It’s been a while but I remember it being surprisingly powerful</li><li><strong>Roma</strong> – Slow-paced to start, but after getting used to it, I started to appreciate how the movie kind of just lets you take things in slowly</li><li><strong>The Gold Rush</strong> – Funny and slightly sad.. and I don’t know about that ending, but still a good time</li>",
      "Honorable mentions",
      "<li><strong>Moonrise Kingdom</strong>, <strong>Living in Oblivion</strong>, <strong>A Face in the Crowd</strong></li>",
      "<strong>Bottom</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag</strong> – Almost nothing good about it.  The best I can say is that it’s at least a semi-coherent story put on film, which takes some effort</li><li><strong>Devil’s Due</strong> – Pretty much the worst of everything of 2010s horror for me</li><li><strong>A Brush with Death</strong> – Bad/amateur acting and uninspired story</li><li><strong>Harvest of Fear</strong> – Pretty much the same as above.. only has a slight edge because of it’s slasher-y nature</li><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – A clip show, basically.. which sucks, but I guess if you’re new to the series, then it’s all new to you so maybe that’s enjoyable on some level?</li><li><strong>Dracula vs. Frankenstein </strong>– Confusing and some weird acting choices</li><li><strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – A boring movie that only has some interesting action in the last 5 minutes</li><li><strong>Psycho a Go-Go</strong> – A less polished version of another Al Adamson movie that he just re-edited or something</li><li><strong>Brain of Blood</strong> – More Al Adamson.. sorry guy.  Just a mad doctor with a monster story but of course has that low quality you’d expect</li><li><strong>Fatal Exam</strong> – The only redeeming thing about this is the late 80s vibe.. but even that’s not strong enough to make up for how terrible everything else is</li>",
      "Dishonorable mentions",
      "<li><strong>The Apparition</strong>, <strong>Mirrors 2</strong>, <strong>The Invisible Woman</strong></li>",
      "I guess I’ll end it with just talking about some random memories of these lists just to preserve those so I don’t forget them someday",
      "<li>I watched some old 60s horror movies while dogsitting at my parents, so I got to watch those on big screen with a projector</li><li>Some watches with b: <strong>Marriage Story</strong>, <strong>Porco Rosso</strong>, <strong>Ponyo</strong>, <strong>A Snake of June</strong>, <strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong>, <strong>Cruising</strong>, <strong>Giant</strong>, <strong>Mirrors 2</strong>, <strong>Resident Evil: Afterlife</strong>, <strong>Dr. No</strong>, <strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</strong>, <strong>Ben-Hur</strong>, <strong>Spartacus</strong>, <strong>Lost Highway</strong>, <strong>Wild at Heart</strong>, <strong>Police Story 2</strong>, some <strong>Godzilla</strong>, some old best picture winners, <strong>Five Fingers of Death</strong> and we still sing to the tune of the <strong>Gamera… Gamera…</strong> song even to this day</li><li>I re-arranged my movie room.  The first movie I watched in the new arrangement was <strong>Alligator</strong> to kick off the <strong>ABCs of Horror</strong> list</li><li>Lots of trips can be seen in the timeline of the lists:<ul><li><strong>March Madness</strong> had a gap where we went skiing in Colorado</li><li><strong>[Horror] Finish the Series</strong> had a gap in the middle where went to NYC</li><li><strong>Decades of Horror</strong> had a gap near the end where did a national parks road trip to Grand Canyon and back</li><li><strong>[Non-Horror] Finish the Series</strong> had a gap early on where we took a road trip up to Deadwood and back</li><li><strong>Halloween 2021</strong> ended over a week before Halloween since we were traveling to Hawaii.</li><li><strong>Blood!</strong> had a gap in early February where I went down to Dallas to wait for her flight, but had to escape some weather and spend most of a week down there</li><li><strong>Backloggin</strong> had a gap where we went to the Great Smoky Mountains</li></ul></li>",
      "I guess that’s all I have to say about that.  It’s been a fun two years and I’m going to keep this train going, but maybe not at the same speed.  I think it’ll be fun to hit the big watchlists hard and then other times, just go at a slow pace and spend some time rewatching some movies.  But I plan to keep buying movies, to keep making lists to watch them and to keep obsessively logging it all!",

      "Time to just summarize things, give an overall top/bottom 10, etc.",
      "<strong>Top 10</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Glengarry Glen Ross</strong> – I guess after months of genre films with questionable acting and writing, a movie that’s really strong in both of those will really stand out for me</li><li><strong>The Northman</strong> – I’d like to watch this again, but on the first watch, it’s just the high quality movie I was expecting in terms of the look, the sound, the cast, all that stuff</li><li><strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong> – This <strong>Genres 2</strong> watchlist gave me a lot of these top movies, huh.. this one was imaginative, visually great and I learned about an interesting real life person/scenario I never knew about</li><li><strong>The Gold Rush</strong> – Hey, a super old movie made it here.  Charlie Chaplin’s sympathetic characters and the physical comedy put his movies above other silent films for me</li><li><strong>In Search of Darkness – Part II</strong> – This is kind of a cheap pick, but if I’m just talking about viewing experiences I enjoyed the most, this is definitely up there.  Entertaining to see so many 80s horror movies and learn about ones I haven’t seen yet</li><li><strong>Moonrise Kingdom</strong> – A fun style of comedy with a setting that I really enjoy, just overall entertaining to watch</li><li><strong>Living in Oblivion</strong> – An actually funny comedy with a really unique kind of vibe and a good cast</li><li><strong>A Face in the Crowd</strong> – A good story showing how an initially genuine person changes with fame and money.  Seems like a movie that could apply to just about any time period</li><li><strong>All Quiet on the Western Front</strong> – Another older one that still stands up today.  I wasn’t expecting an older movie to be as upfront and brutal about war</li><li><strong>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</strong> – I thought this one might be higher in my list, but after watching it, I found it good but didn’t quite hit me the way it seems to hit others.. but still a very nice movie</li>",
      "Honorable mentions (in no particular order)",
      "<li><strong>Kagemusha</strong> – Good but doesn’t quite stack up to other Kurosawa movies for me</li><li><strong>Ponyo</strong> – Similar to above but replace “Kurosawa” with “Studio Ghibli”</li><li><strong>Cemetery of Terror</strong> – Let’s throw a horror movie in here for fun.  It’s cheesy, yes, but taking place on Halloween and mixing slasher and zombies.. that’s a good time</li>",
      "<strong>Bottom 10</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag</strong> – I’m getting tired of typing out this whole title and I have to type it a lot because it’s always at the “Bottom” of almost every list.  Just a bad movie in every regard</li><li><strong>Fatal Exam</strong> – Also really bad all around, but maybe it’s that late 80s, early 90s nostalgia that padded the score just a bit, but still it was bad</li><li><strong>Legacy of Blood</strong> – Very uneventful and not really interesting in any other aspect</li><li><strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> – A really weak <strong>Godzilla</strong> movie that’s just a kid dreaming about <strong>Godzilla</strong> scenes, I think just from previous movies, and about little baby Godzilla Jr</li><li><strong>Witchtrap</strong> – A fairly bland 80s horror movie but the main character was just so poorly written that it actively annoyed me</li><li><strong>Psychos</strong> – Another one of those super low budget, super amateur movies that just happens to be newer, so the technology is <em>slightly</em> better but the acting and all that is still really bad</li><li><strong>Bloodthirsty Butchers</strong> – Another Andy Milligan movie.. he’s this year’s Al Adamson I guess.  I just didn’t get into this story that just bounced around to a bunch of disconnected scenes</li><li><strong>Psychos in Love</strong> – A slasher comedy with bad comedy and the slashing was just.. eh</li><li><strong>Five Bloody Graves</strong> – Al Adamson is still here though.. but this time with a western.  It’s bad and it’s a little offensive, but it’s semi-competently made I guess</li><li><strong>Blood Theatre</strong> – Really low quality but I <em>almost</em> liked it just because of the setting and something kind of.. comfort food-y about it.. but it was still really bad acting</li>",
      "Dishorable mentions (in no particular order)",
      "<li><strong>Hard Ticket to Hawaii</strong> – This has already popped up a lot.. I kept it out of the bottom 10 just for the few ridiculous over-the-top scenes that this movie is kind of known for.. but in terms of quality, it’s about as bad as anything else in the list</li><li><strong>The Black Cat</strong> – I just remember not liking the general style of the movie and it’s just a re-telling of a story told in many other, better ways</li><li><strong>Jeepers Creepers 2 </strong>– Just not into these movies that much I guess and the overly annoying characters and character drama put me off even more</li><li><strong>Fright Night 2: New Blood</strong> – Again, annoyingly bad characters just really turned me off right from the start</li>",

      "Last year I did a few superlative type things, so I guess I’ll see if I can line those up to Year Two movies here:",
      "<li><strong>Most Surprising</strong> – <strong>A Field in England</strong> – I wasn’t sure what to expect out of this but this kind of trippy, kind of slowburn, kind of artsy type of movie was not what I expected at all</li><li><strong>Most Disappointing</strong> – <strong>Terror in the Aisles</strong> – Maybe not fair, but it’s probably just due to my own expectations.  I thought there would be a little more commentary and substance than just a bunch of clips, so that’s on me</li><li><strong>Most Confusing</strong> – <strong>Southland Tales</strong> – I’d probably have to rewatch it and read up on it a little more to try to get all this little details.  I enjoyed my experience with it though, just kind of accepting some of the confusing stuff and moving on with my life</li><li><strong>Most Unique</strong> – <strong>Häxan</strong> – I’m not sure I’ve seen a movie that is kind of part educational/documentary style then full narrative style.  And given its age, it makes it stand out even more</li><li><strong>Most Forgettable</strong> – <strong>Beast of Blood</strong> – I suppose any of these Philippines horror movies could fit here.. they were all so similar.  But re-reading my post about this one and I still can’t quite remember anything distinct about this movie</li>",
      "And this year, I just want to log a few random movies that I think I’d like to watch again (excluding the Top 10/honorable mentions because..obviously I’d want to watch those again).  These aren’t necessarily the “top” movies but just ones worth revisiting:",
      "<li><strong>The Third Man</strong> – I think I need to watch it again with a little more focus and I’d appreciate it more</li><li><strong>Viy</strong> – I don’t know why, I just liked this simple setup</li><li><strong>Battle Beyond the Stars</strong> – I figure, one of these days, I’ll be in the mood for a cheesy space adventure and this is a good go-to</li><li><strong>The Passion of Joan of Arc</strong> – Again, I think I kind of “missed” what makes this so great, I’d like to rewatch with a bit more focus</li><li><strong>The Boneyard</strong> – Another one where, if I’m in the mood for some cheesy 90s horror like what I’d rent from the video store in high school, this is it</li>",

      "Ratings are always fun to look at as a bit of a numbers nerd.  As I’ve probably said before, I try to give my own honest rating of a movie based on how I feel about it and not let the hype, reputation or other user ratings influence my decision too much.  In the end, the ratings don’t matter, but I do like to try to see where I’m at compared to the general audience on certain movies or genres.  My ratings are still usually not too extreme.. a 9 is usually about as high as I’ll go on a first viewing and it’s not common for me to go lower than a 3, but it does happen.

      "It looks like my 7s and 7.5s have shifted down a bit to where I’m sitting at 6.5 a lot more now.  Year Two is definitely a more natural bell curve.  Either I’m watching movies that are a little more lackluster or I’ve started to consider 7+ as being a tougher gate.  I think it’s a bit of both, for sure some of the latter.  When I started, I definitely remember throwing out 7s for movies that, thinking back, I would have guessed I was more like a 6-6.5.  But otherwise, the Great/Amazing range is roughly the same.. only a handful each year make it that high.  Another funny thing to note is that I didn’t have any in the “awful” range this year, but one passed all the way down into the extremely rare “Woah..” territory.  And that was <strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag</strong>.  That was just an awful experience.  I was a little less harsh on movies this year, but not much.  So I guess the takeaway is that I lean into the 5.5-6.5 range a lot.. but with a lot of these movies, I just don’t know where else I would go with them.  For instance, 80s slashers and cheesy sci-fi movies aren’t great but.. they’re entertaining.",
      "The overall average rating for the entire year is <strong>6.04</strong>, compared to last year’s <strong>6.17</strong>.  So a little lower, but not by a significant amount.  Now let’s talk a little more about my ratings vs the general public’s ratings.  Here’s a chart that just measures “was I over or under compared to the average user rating?” and go up or down depending:",

      "Big difference.  Year One, I never went net negative.  I think it was partially the excitement of just starting out on this experiment that made me a little over-enthusiastic on some early ratings.  I dipped a lot during the <strong>Gamera</strong> movies and then back up over <strong>March Madness</strong>.  Makes sense.. I struggled through those <strong>Gamera</strong> movies a little bit, I guess just not quite for me, but I had a lot of fun during <strong>March Madness</strong>.  Also in the <strong>[Horror] Finish the Series</strong> list, I was pretty generous to those often low-rated horror sequels.  Guess I’m just a cheesy horror softie at heart.  I finally ended Year One at a net positive of <strong>+50</strong>.. meaning I overrated roughly <strong>150</strong> movies compared to my underrating <strong>100</strong> movies.. so that’s a fairly large gap.",
      "Looking closer at Year Two, it’s a different story.  I immediately hit net negative right out of the gate but jumped way up late in <strong>Halloween 2021</strong> and through most of <strong>Days of Listmas</strong>.  Again, I was just having fun and I guess my ratings are a little more generous.  I remember being fairly positive on a lot of 80s slashers around those lists, which is not usually typical for me.  I guess it’s all about your frame of mind.  But then I remember being pretty unimpressed with a lot of the <strong>Blood!</strong> list and the <strong>March Madness 2</strong> list was a little underwhelming compared to the previous year.  I dipped back down into the negatives again with <strong>The Missing Years</strong>.  I think that’s because I don’t appreciate the older movies as much as a lot of the Letterboxd cinephiles do.  I find them significant and impressive for their time, but as a viewing experience, a lot of times, it just doesn’t do it for me.  The rating balance slowly clawed its way back up to a positive, then dipped a bit right at the end of this year, finally settling at a net positive <strong>+1</strong>.  So basically, I was close to overrating <strong>126</strong> and underrating <strong>124</strong>.  It doesn’t quite line up because there were some where I was exactly the same to the decimal.  A lot more balanced this year, but maybe that’s a result of my ratings being a little more tempered (more 6s, fewer 7s).",
      "Let’s dig a little deeper into where I was way too low and way too high compared to other viewers",
      "<strong>Movies I Underrated</strong>",
      "<li><strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag</strong> – [<strong>2.00</strong> vs <strong>5.54</strong>, diff: <strong>-3.54</strong>] – I refuse to believe anyone not involved in the making of this movie would give it more than a 4 out of 10.  I have to chalk this up to small sample size, at least.  One of the worst I’ve seen in all my years</li><li><strong>Psychos in Love</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong> vs <strong>6.58</strong>, diff: <strong>-2.58</strong>] – I don’t feel like I was SO low here.. a 4 isn’t like I HATED it.  The surprising thing is how high the general viewer rating was.  6.5 out of 10??  I guess people saw something in it that I just didn’t</li><li><strong>The Passion of Joan of Arc</strong> – [<strong>6.50</strong> vs <strong>8.74</strong>, diff: <strong>-2.24</strong>] – I know, I know.. this is an impressive old piece of cinema.  For my viewing, I found it “good” but I wasn’t quite as into this one as some of the other silent films I watched.  I guess I may have missed some of what makes it truly great</li><li><strong>Hard Ticket to Hawaii</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong> vs <strong>6.10</strong>, diff: <strong>-2.10</strong>] – I have to imagine people’s ratings here are for the “so bad it’s good” meme type purposes and not a realistic assessment of how good this movie is.  It’s entertaining but it’s just so poorly written and acted..</li><li><strong>Seeds</strong> – [<strong>5.00</strong> vs <strong>6.96</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.96</strong>] – I found that I’m not much of an Andy Milligan fan.  I appreciate that these low budget filmmakers followed their passions and all that, but this movie was so disjointed to me</li><li><strong>Versus</strong> – [<strong>5.00</strong> vs <strong>6.66</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.66</strong>] – The low budget, homemade action scenes in the woods type of thing just didn’t grab me.  It kind of gave me that vibe of if me and some high school friends trying to make an action movie</li><li><strong>Bloody Moon</strong> – [<strong>4.50</strong> vs <strong>6.04</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.54</strong>] – Not sure what about this middle-of-the-road slasher put other people a little higher than average.  Maybe it was the awkwardness of the dubbing that made it a little less bearable for me, I don’t quite remember, but I wasn’t too impressed, I know that</li><li><strong>The Black Cat</strong> – [<strong>4.50</strong> vs <strong>6.04</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.54</strong>] – If I’m even remembering this one correctly, I think it was kind of a 60s surf rock version of the old black cat story..?  I dunno, it didn’t do anything for me and the style didn’t fit the story much at all</li><li><strong>The Adventure of Denchu-Kozo</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong> vs <strong>7.02</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.52</strong>] – Admittedly, this low budget, kind of out there style of movie is hard for me to get into.  I like something with a little bit more polish or traditional narrative.  I don’t think it was bad, really, just not a good fit for me</li><li><strong>The Last Laugh</strong> – [<strong>6.50</strong> vs <strong>8.00</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.50</strong>] – Again, it’s just an issue of me not gelling with some of these old silent films</li>",
      "<strong>Movies I Overrated</strong>",
      "<li><strong>King Kong</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.58</strong>, diff: <strong>1.92</strong>] – I remember it being a pretty decent re-telling of the old Kong story and Jeff Bridges is cool.  Maybe 7.5 is a little high, but I think 5.58 is too low for a pretty standard/ok movie</li><li><strong>Butch and Sundance: The Early Days</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.60</strong>, diff: <strong>1.90</strong>] – This is probably a case where the original <strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong> is kind of just “fine” to me.  It doesn’t hold any special place in my mind, so this sequel is not affected by the original at all and I like the actors and it’s at least fun</li><li><strong>Southland Tales</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.70</strong>, diff: <strong>1.80</strong>] – Again, just surprisingly low for a movie that I thought did some interesting things.  Some social commentary/satire, some sci-fi concepts and a pretty recognizable cast with some funny bits here and there.  Maybe I went in with low expectations since it starred The Rock and came out pleasantly surprised</li><li><strong>Don’t Answer the Phone</strong> – [<strong>7.00</strong> vs <strong>5.30</strong>, diff: <strong>1.70</strong>] – This was one of the 80s slashers I liked the best from this year.  I guess because the killer was pretty disturbing, moreso than most of these other slashers.  If a slasher villain can make me feel at least a little grossed out anymore, I feel that’s at least something</li><li><strong>Chino</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.96</strong>, diff: <strong>1.54</strong>] – Maybe I was just in the right mood for a simple, low-key western that was just about a guy, not some epic struggle or a town in danger or anything.  Charles Bronson is pretty “flat” but somehow I still enjoy it</li><li><strong>Cutting Class</strong> – [<strong>6.50</strong> vs <strong>5.02</strong>, diff: <strong>1.48</strong>] – I don’t have any strong opinions about this movie.. it’s just a slasher with Brad Pitt that takes place in and around a high school.  Kind of fun, but not too notable.  Not sure why it would be quite as low as a 5 for the average viewer, but I wouldn’t argue it too much</li><li><strong>The Bloodhound</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>6.08</strong>, diff: <strong>1.42</strong>] – I’m not surprised here.. I have a bit of a soft spot for some of these slow burn types.. and a 6 average user rating is still decent, but I think a lot of people are a bit put off by the “nothing really happens” part.. or maybe they felt that the payoff just wasn’t worth it.  I can see that</li><li><strong>Bitter Feast</strong> – [<strong>7.00</strong> vs <strong>5.68</strong>, diff: <strong>1.32</strong>] – I only remember the basic premise and that it was fairly entertaining, but I don’t really remember enough to defend a 7.  Could have just been that Halloween high causing me to go a little overboard on ratings</li><li><strong>Scared to Death</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong> vs <strong>4.20</strong>, diff: <strong>1.30</strong>] – Wow, I actually thought I was kind of low on this one, but the average user rating is SUPER low, one of the worst I’ve ever seen.  The movie was just a run-of-the-mill old horror in a big house kind of thing, but it didn’t strike me as totally awful, just kind of uninteresting.</li><li><strong>Glengarry Glen Ross</strong> – [<strong>9.00</strong> vs <strong>7.74</strong>, diff: <strong>1.26</strong>] – Woah woah.. ok, well it’s understandable since I was all the way up at a 9.  The average user rating is good, but I’m surprised it isn’t just a little higher.  With this cast and this writing, it’s just a lot of fun to watch</li>",
      "<strong>Movies Where I Was Exactly the Same</strong>",
      "Apparently there were a few where I was right on the money:",
      "<li><strong>All Quiet on the Western Front</strong> – [<strong>8.00</strong>] – An old classic, relevant today.. one time where I “got” an older movie</li><li><strong>Killing</strong> – [<strong>7.00</strong>] – It’s a decent samurai movie, very simple and low budget, but does what it sets out to do</li><li><strong>The Unseen</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong>] – Honestly, I barely remember this movie and it was just from a couple months ago.  I guess a mid-5 says it all.. not good, not terrible, not memorable</li><li><strong>976-EVIL</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong>] – Nothing really significant about it, just a standard late 80s horror movie</li><li><strong>Blood Theatre</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong>] – Yeah pretty bad comedy, really bad acting and characters.  Super low rating as far as average user ratings go, but I’m right there with them</li>",
      "I could talk on and on about these ratings, but I better not.  I think the fun thing about this year was how balanced the ratings were.  In general:",
      "<li><strong>Way Under (more than -1.5 diff): 9</strong></li><li><strong>Under (more than -0.25 diff): 83</strong></li><li><strong>Barely Under (within -0.25 diff): 20</strong></li><li><strong>Close (between -0.1 and 0.1 diff): 24</strong></li><li><strong>Barely Over (within 0.25 diff): 18</strong></li><li><strong>Over (more than 0.25 diff): 91</strong></li><li><strong>Way Over (more than 1.5 diff): 5</strong></li>",
      "Pretty even, just by coincidence.",
      "I think that’s about all there is to say for now about ratings.  Next, I can sum up Year Two as a whole, then maybe another summary about everything so far all together.. all <strong>500 </strong>movies and all <strong>18 </strong>watchlists.",

      "Yes I’m still doing this kind of ambiguous “categories” thing where it’s not quite a genre, it’s not quite a sub-genre.. it’s just an arbitrary grouping of movies.  Kind of a “custom genre” but sometimes it’s not a genre at all.. like <strong>Kagemusha</strong> and <strong>Destroy All Monsters</strong> would both be filed under the “Japanese” category.. but giallo movies have their own category instead of “Italian”.. weird, huh?  I’ve thought about trying to switch to something more like tags where a movie could be both Japanese and Monster and Sci-Fi, for example.. but I’ll have to think it through.  But anyway, for now, with the categories I do maintain:",
      "<li><strong>80s Slashers</strong> – [<strong>34</strong> movies, <strong>5.72</strong> avg] – Of course.. my bread and butter.  Even if the bread is sometimes stale and the butter is sometimes “I Can’t Believe it’s Not Butter”.  I went pretty hard on the slashers in the early part of Year Two with <strong>11</strong> for <strong>Halloween 2021</strong> (<strong>10</strong> for the category, but one of the “Exploitation” movies counted as well) and <strong>9</strong> for the <strong>Days of Listmas</strong> watchlist.  Some were not bad, but most were average at best<ul><li>Top: <strong>Cemetery of Terror</strong> – I think I already mentioned this before, but it’s a tough choice with <strong>Fade to Black</strong></li><li>Bottom: <strong>Psychos in Love</strong> – I kind of really didn’t like the attempted comedy</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>16</strong> movies, <strong>5.75</strong> avg] – Basically doubled the amount but the ratings are consistent.  Most 80s slashers are just in that typical 5-6 range</li></ul></li><li><strong>Japanese</strong> – [<strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>6.24</strong> avg] – Lots of stuff here.. over half were <strong>Godzilla</strong> movies (<strong>14</strong>.. <strong>10</strong> from <strong>Halloween 2021</strong>, <strong>4</strong> from <strong>March Madness 2</strong>), some samurai movies, some other dramas<ul><li>Top: <strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong> – I feel like this has already appeared in multiple “top” places so not much more to say</li><li>Bottom: <strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> – Similar to above.. </li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>31</strong> movies, <strong>6.31</strong> avg] – Not a whole lot of difference.  Swap in <strong>Godzilla</strong> with <strong>Gamera</strong> and you’ve got a couple similar lists</li></ul></li><li><strong>Action</strong> – [<strong>13</strong> movies, <strong>5.92</strong> avg] – Some fun stuff from <strong>Days of Listmas</strong> and this includes Martial Arts movies, but was kind of dragged down by the 1987 action movies from <strong>Genres 2</strong><ul><li>Top: <strong>Five Shaolin Masters</strong> – I’m a fan of the group dynamic action movies</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Hard Ticket to Hawaii</strong> – I still get this theme song stuck in my head sometimes..</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>12</strong> movies, <strong>6.75</strong> avg] – Similar number of movies, but last year was much better.  Maybe because a good chunk of those were “classic” action movies, so those were bound to be pretty decent</li></ul></li><li><strong>Western</strong> – [<strong>13</strong> movies, <strong>6.08</strong> avg] – Surprisingly spanned a handful of watchlists.  A couple were more horror westerns, but I categorized them as westerns just the same<ul><li>Top: <strong>Chino</strong> – Very simple but hey, it works for me</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Five Bloody Graves</strong> – Al Adamson + Western.. you know how that ends up</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.91</strong> avg] – Again, similar number but much higher last year.  I guess I enjoyed those <strong>Sartana</strong> movies and some more classic Hollywood westerns last year</li></ul></li><li><strong>Giallo</strong> – [<strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.41</strong> avg] – A consistently above average category for me.  I may not be able to distinguish between all the gialli I’ve watched, but I pretty much always enjoy my viewing experience<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Fifth Cord</strong> – Winner of <strong>March Madness 2</strong>, was a little more technically polished than other gialli</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Crazy Desires of a Murderer</strong> – Really forgettable</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>8</strong> movies, <strong>6.69</strong> avg] – A little more volume this year, a little less quality.  But overall, giallo movies pretty much always will land in that comfortable mid-6 range</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sci-Fi</strong> – [<strong>7</strong> movies, <strong>6.21</strong> avg] – This is not a very precise category.. I feel there are several movies that could have or could have not been considered “sci-fi”, but either way.. it was a fairly small group of movies<ul><li>Top: <strong>Battle Beyond the Stars</strong> – If I had to pick one, I guess this is it.  I just remember it being fairly imaginative and adventurous</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Dungeonmaster</strong> – One of those that was borderline sci-fi, but not a great movie</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>9</strong> movies, <strong>6.17</strong> avg] – Pretty similar, actually</li></ul></li><li><strong>Documentary</strong> – [<strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>6.83</strong> avg] – Actually a newer category I added this year since I found myself running into a few of these<ul><li>Top: <strong>In Search of Darkness – Part II</strong> – Just a bunch of 80s horror clips and commentary.. what’s not to like?</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Terror in the Aisles</strong> – Similarly, just a bunch of clips but without any real commentary or discussion to make it interesting</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vincent Price</strong> – [<strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>6.83</strong> avg] – Identical to <strong>Documentary</strong>, weird.  Anyway, I’ve almost exhausted all the VP movies I can, which is sad.  It was a fun Halloween staple while it lasted<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Haunted Palace</strong> – Loved the setting and atmosphere</li><li>Bottom: <strong>House of the Long Shadows</strong> – Not terrible, but it was a weird mix of classic and modern (well, for the 80s) horror that didn’t always work</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>8</strong> movies, <strong>6.25</strong> avg] – Surprisingly was quite a bit higher this year than last on my ratings</li></ul></li><li><strong>Universal</strong> – [<strong>5</strong> movies, <strong>5.70</strong> avg] – I’m also running low on classic Universal horror, so I did a handful for <strong>Halloween 2021</strong> and that’s it<ul><li>Top: <strong>Man Made Monster</strong> – At least had a sympathetic main character</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Monster and the Girl</strong> – Not much monster to it</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>6.04</strong> avg] – Woah, I watched a LOT of them last year.  I guess that’s why I’m running out of them now..</li></ul></li>",
      "The rest are fairly inconsequential.. <strong>Drama</strong> with <strong>4</strong>, <strong>Sci-Fi Horror</strong> with <strong>2</strong>, <strong>Comedy Horror</strong> with <strong>1</strong> and <strong>Hammer</strong> with <strong>1</strong>.  I feel like <strong>Sci-Fi Horror</strong> and <strong>Comedy Horror</strong> are probably not the best categories.. they started out of my initial <strong>Halloween 2020</strong> watchlist due to some of those categories and stuck around.  But it’s a fine line.. so I guess a Year Three goal is re-work the category system.  Maybe break out categories into separate attributes.. genre/sub-genre, actor/actress, country/language.  We’ll see..",
      "Anyway, a big year for 80s slashers and I bet Year Three will have another good chunk of those.. and for Japanese movies, I still have a handful of <strong>Godzilla</strong> movies left.. although not all of those are Japanese.. but either way, it’s still fun to look at more cohesively grouped sets of movies, so I’ll keep doing that in some form",

    content: [
      "We’re talkin’ labels.  Like last year, a ton of these movies were boutique labels.  Let’s take a look, starting with the most common for Year Two and working our way down:",
      "<li><strong>Scream Factory</strong> – [<strong>44</strong> movies, <strong>6.09</strong> avg] – Like last year, Scream Factory is the king, but not by a whole lot.  Just to break it down, this was <strong>10</strong> Collectors Editions and <strong>34</strong> others.  I usually like what they put out and I think a 6+ rating says I generally liked this year’s lot as well<ul><li>Top: <strong>Vice Squad</strong> – A grimey action/crime thriller with a pretty unlikeable villain</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Jeepers Creepers 2</strong> – Awful characters and the special effects on the monster were questionable</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>63</strong> movies, <strong>6.24</strong> avg] – A lot more last year and better quality, maybe partly due to the Larry Fessenden movies.  Also I burned through a lot of the Universal sets last year</li></ul></li><li><strong>Arrow</strong> – [<strong>41</strong> movies, <strong>6.17</strong> avg] – Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.. maybe next year, Arrow.  Again, super close to Scream Factor in the volume, but again better than SF in average rating.  This year we had some martial arts, exploitation, western and a lot of just one off movies<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Bloodhound</strong> – Tough call, but I’ll give it the edge since I just like those atmospheric modern slowburns</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Sting of Death</strong> – Pretty laughable monster effects and kind of a bore</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>59</strong> movies, <strong>6.31</strong> avg] – Way more last year and slightly higher quality.  As much as I generally like Arrow releases, this year didn’t have many stand-outs, just a handful of solid-to-good type movies</li></ul></li><li><strong>Severin</strong> – [<strong>29</strong> movies, <strong>5.43</strong> avg] – In third like last year.  At least this year was partially salvaged by the so-far great Horror Folk set, which is a few notches above a lot of other Severin releases<ul><li>Top: <strong>A Field in England</strong> – Trippy historic folk horror movie, interesting watch</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Legacy of Blood</strong> – As said before, super boring until something finally happens at the end</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>13</strong> movies, <strong>4.73</strong> avg] – Over doubled the count from the previous year and with a significant bump in quality.  I think it was, as mentioned, the folk horror stuff and also some giallo movies that were the difference makers this year</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vinegar Syndrome</strong> – [<strong>24</strong> movies, <strong>5.46</strong> avg] – VS made a pretty big jump this year and it’s largely thanks to 80s slashers.  In fact, that was half of the VS movies.  The other half were gialli and then some one-offs<ul><li>Top: <strong>Cemetery of Terror</strong> – Tough choice between <strong>Fade to Black</strong> but the Halloween setting + zombies tips the scales</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Fatal Exam</strong> – This will probably show up on a lot of my “worst of” lists, so I don’t know what more to say</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>5.95</strong> avg] – More than doubled again, but at the cost of quality.  This crop of 80s slashers were not exactly <em>great</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Criterion</strong> – [<strong>19</strong> movies, <strong>6.53</strong> avg] – Woah, what’s Criterion doing all the way up here.  Well I’ve got one word for you.. well two.. actually three: “It’s because of <strong>Godzilla</strong>“.  But that also cost it some in the average rating since that was over half and most of them were not very good.  Fun fact, <strong>12</strong> of these <strong>19</strong> were Japanese films.. huh<ul><li>Top: <strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong> – Interesting story based on a real.. interesting.. dude</li><li>Bottom: <strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> – Of course this is the worst, no doubt</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>7.83</strong> avg] – Last year was only a few movies but they packed a punch.  Take out the <strong>Godzilla</strong> movies this year and we’d be in a pretty similar spot</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kino Lorber</strong> – [<strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.55</strong> avg] – Consistent old KL.  I find most of the movies they put out are in that “decent, not bad” category.  From silent films, to westerns, to action thrillers.. I’ve gotten to know what to expect from them and it’s pretty solid<ul><li>Top: <strong>Chino</strong> – Not far and away the favorite, it’s actually close with another Charles Bronson movie, <strong>Mr. Majestyk</strong>.  Those could easily swap for me.  I didn’t even realize I was a Charles Bronson fan but.. huh, here we are</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Class Reunion</strong> – A pretty rough slasher comedy that didn’t age too well</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.18</strong> avg] – Same number, but a higher rating this year.  I guess just not many lows this year (only one below a 6)</li></ul></li>",
      "Those were the most significant.. for those other labels with far fewer:",
      "<li><strong>Vestron</strong> – [<strong>4</strong> movies, <strong>5.88</strong> avg] – Most of these came at the end.  <strong>Extreme Prejudice</strong> was a serviceable action movie, <strong>Dementia 13</strong> was kind of a forgettable older horror movie</li><li><strong>Code Red</strong> – [<strong>3</strong> movies, <strong>6.00</strong> avg] – A couple of slashers and a zombie movie.  Not bad.  <strong>The Boneyard</strong> is the one I’d most like to rewatch</li><li><strong>Blue Underground</strong>, <strong>MVD </strong>and <strong>Synapse</strong> had <strong>1</strong> each, not very significant players this year</li>",
      "This time, Scream Factory + Arrow was a little less dominant than before, with a total of <strong>85</strong> out of the <strong>250</strong>.  So about <strong>1/3</strong>.  This time, the extra were spread out more to <strong>Severin</strong>, <strong>Vinegar Syndrome</strong> and <strong>Criterion</strong>.  Most other labels were pretty similar.",
      "Looking forward, I still have a lot of <strong>Severin</strong> to watch (<strong>70</strong>), a decent amount of <strong>Arrow</strong> (<strong>50</strong>), some <strong>Vinegar Syndrome</strong> (<strong>33</strong>) and then some scattered handfuls of other labels.  I’m not quite sure how many <strong>Scream Factory</strong> are left since I only currently have a Letterboxd list of the Collectors Editions only, which is only <strong>6</strong> unwatched at this current time.  The non-Collectors Editions, I could only guess.. but I’d think it’s at least around 30ish.. just a guess.",
      "I suppose, based on my enjoyment levels, I should invest more into <strong>Kino Lorber</strong> and <strong>Criterion</strong>.  I may not get as much horror in my lists, but I’ve got to balance that schlocky horror out with something!",

      "Now it’s time to dissect the years and decades of Year Two.  Taking a look specifically at decades:",
      "<li><strong>1920s</strong> – [<strong>10</strong> movies, <strong>6.65</strong> avg] – Thanks to <strong>The Missing Years</strong> watchlist, I completely filled out the 20s with a mix of old old horror and some drama/comedy.  It’s not really my style and pace, but it was really interesting to see some of the techniques used way back then<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Gold Rush</strong> – Charlie Chaplin movies are always fun and he’s always a likeable character</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Broadway Melody</strong> – Not much of a musical guy, especially this old style</li></ul></li><li><strong>1930s</strong> – [<strong>5</strong> movies, <strong>7.10</strong> avg] – Also all due to <strong>The Missing Years</strong>.  The 30s movies were definitely noticeably advanced compared to the 20s<ul><li>Top: <strong>All Quiet on the Western Front</strong> – Surprisingly honest movie about war</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Maniac</strong> – Just a typical mad scientist style of movie, not too interesting</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>6.67</strong> avg] – Better this year due to some classic dramas</li></ul></li><li><strong>1940s</strong> – [<strong>7</strong> movies, <strong>5.93</strong> avg] – A mix of <strong>The Missing Years</strong> and the Universal block of <strong>Halloween 2021</strong>.  Pretty significant dip in the quality of the movies from the 20s and 30s.  Probably because it was mostly just forgotten horror movies at this point.<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Third Man</strong> – I liked it ok but it didn’t quite click with me like I would expect.  Maybe needs another watch</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Monster and the Girl</strong> – A pretty boring movie that then suddenly had a gorilla</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>15</strong> movies, <strong>5.70</strong> avg] – Slightly better quality in Year Two but about half the quantity</li></ul></li><li><strong>1950s</strong> – [<strong>9</strong> movies, <strong>6.17</strong> avg] – Pretty wide variety of watchlists here, mostly horror.  But there were a few oldies, a drama, and a couple westerns.  Those were all right, but the horror from the decade were almost all just mediocre<ul><li>Top: <strong>A Face in the Crowd</strong> – Interesting character study and feels relevant today</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Terror is a Man</strong> – Cheesy cat-like creature movie</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>10</strong> movies, <strong>6.45</strong>] – I guess last year’s crop was a little better</li></ul></li><li><strong>1960s</strong> – [<strong>28</strong> movies, <strong>5.66</strong> avg] – A sudden jump from the 5-10 per decade to almost 30.  The 60s is where I start really getting interested in movies, even though there are some pre-60s that I like too, of course.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Spartacus</strong> – I hoped for a bit more, but it’s still a historic epic directed by Stanley Kubrick</li><li>Bottom: <strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> – The worst of the <strong>Godzilla</strong> movies to me, just a kid dreaming about lil Godzilla Jr</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>38</strong> movies, <strong>6.08</strong> avg] – More movies last year AND significantly better</li></ul></li><li><strong>1970s</strong> – [<strong>55</strong> movies, <strong>6.11</strong> avg] – Now we’re entering the sweet spot of my movie fandom.  Nearly double the amount from the 60s.  There was all kinds of stuff.. horror, westerns, gialli, martial arts.  The average rating shows that I got a pretty decent batch of movies.. not spectacular but overall nice<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</strong> – Well-done crime movie</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Legacy of Blood</strong> – A pretty boring movie for a title like that</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>40</strong> movies, <strong>6.03</strong> avg] – Kicked it up a notch this year with more movies and slightly better quality.  Might have been too much <strong>Gamera</strong> last year that hurt it</li></ul></li><li><strong>1980s</strong> – [<strong>79</strong> movies, <strong>5.83</strong> avg] – Ah, the 80s.  You know there are a lot of slashers here (<strong>34</strong> if we’re counting), but also a bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in there as well.  But in the end, it’s the drama movies from the decade that stood on top<ul><li>Top: <strong>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</strong> – Artsy and entertaining</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Witchtrap</strong> – It’s hard to choose a least favorite but I was so annoyed by the main guy’s “humor”</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>52</strong> movies, <strong>6.04</strong> avg] – Quantity over quality this year, I suppose.  I went a lot harder on the 80s slashers and a lot of them weren’t that good..</li></ul></li><li><strong>1990s</strong> – [<strong>19</strong> movies, <strong>6.08</strong> avg] – Surprisingly light on 90s movies this year.  90s horror is not particularly popular, so maybe that’s why I didn’t have a lot of movies here.  Mostly non-horror and <strong>Godzilla</strong> movies this time, but with a few pure horror movies sprinkled in<ul><li>Top: <strong>Glengarry Glen Ross</strong> – Great cast and great acting</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Fatal Exam</strong> – Bad cast and bad acting</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>40</strong> movies, <strong>6.51</strong> avg] – I really watched quite a bit of 90s movies in that first year and they were surprisingly more enjoyable than this time around</li></ul></li><li><strong>2000s</strong> – [<strong>9</strong> movies, <strong>5.89</strong> avg] – I can’t believe, out of 250 movies, only <strong>9</strong> were in the 2000-2009 range.  And almost half of those were non-horror.  I guess just not a popular decade for the movies I typically buy.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Ponyo</strong> – High Ghibli quality, but a little bit of a kids movie</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of the Black Hodag</strong> – One of the worst movies I’ve seen.. I can honestly say that</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>23</strong> movies, <strong>6.04</strong> avg] – Again, more quantity last year and more quality.  Guess just not a good year for that 90s/00s period</li></ul></li><li><strong>2010s</strong> – [<strong>23</strong> movies, <strong>6.15</strong> avg] – After a lull in the 90s and 00s, we’re back to a reasonable number of movies.  It’s a mix of a lot of things, some Horror Pack movies, some more dramatic movies and even a couple of documentary style movies.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Moonrise Kingdom</strong> – I like the comedic style and the setting, maybe because I’m not Wes Anderson fatigued yet</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Psychos</strong> – Pretty low quality, poor acting.. just not a lot of redeemable stuff there</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>6.36</strong> avg] – Really similar number of movies, but, again, Year One got the better group of movies</li></ul></li><li><strong>2020s</strong> – [<strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>7.50</strong> avg] – You know we’re creeping further into the decade when more and more 2020s movies start making their way into these lists.  Arrow introduced me to a couple of cool newer horror movies and there were a few horror docs<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Northman</strong> – The quality I was expecting with a satisfying story</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Who is Bill Rebane?</strong> – Interesting, but something about it seemed unpolished</li><li>Compared to Year One: [<strong>1</strong> movie, <strong>7.50</strong> avg] – Basically, it was <strong>Bill and Ted Face the Music</strong> compared to these <strong>6</strong> movies, but hey.. same average rating so that’s fun</li></ul></li>",
      "In order, best-to-worst, that’s 2020s, 1930s, 1920s, 1950s, 2010s, 1970s, 1990s, 1940s, 2000s, 1980s, 1960s.  I love the 80s, but I have to admit the quality of those movies is not always <em>great</em>.. but it’s nostalgia and I’ll watch them anyways.  Surprised at how the top two decades are almost a century apart.",
      "And, if we’re pitting Year One against Year Two in terms of average rating per decade, the record comes out in favor of Year One 6-3-1 (one tie, the 2020s.. and one not counted, the 1920s, since there were none from that decade in Year One).  I guess there are a couple potential reasons.. one is that I’ve gotten a little harsher when I give a rating.  Another is that I watched more movies that I was more excited about early on and was left with more movies in Year Two that I was kind of “eh” about from the beginning.  Either way, I think both years had their highs and lows, so no complaints.",
      "Ok so what else is interesting about these years?",
      "<li>The two eras that were most dominant were <strong>1972-1974</strong> with <strong>28</strong> movies between them and <strong>1987-1989</strong> with <strong>33</strong> movies between them.  That’s <strong>61</strong> movies just from that handful of years, almost 1/4 of the entire year.</li><li>Even though I’ve covered all years from 1920-2022 when including both years, if just looking at Year Two, there are some years missing: 1931, 1933, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1951, 1953, 1958, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2011… good for <strong>18</strong> missing years out of what.. <strong>103</strong>?</li><li>The 80s alone was <strong>79</strong> movies.. out of <strong>250</strong> that’s almost <strong>1/3</strong>.. madness.  Add in the 70s with its <strong>55</strong> movies and that’s <strong>134</strong>, well over <strong>1/2</strong>.  But those are my comfort zone decades, so not too surprising</li>",

    date: "July 31, 2022",
    content: [
      "Ahh.. finally time to look back at the past year.  Similar to when I looked at Year One, I’ll start with Watchlists.  This time it was <strong>8</strong> watchlists total (compared to Year One’s <strong>10</strong>).  There were no short lists this year, the shortest still being <strong>23</strong> movies.  Half of them were <strong>30+</strong> and the other half in the <strong>20s</strong>.  They typically took about 1-1.5 months to complete, except of course <strong>Halloween 2021</strong>, which was nearly two months.  Let’s take a closer look at each:",
      "<li><strong>Halloween 2021</strong> – [<strong>50</strong> movies, <strong>5.93</strong> avg] – Of course there always has to be a Halloween list.  Always categorized and grouped in weeks.  The categories that were the same between <strong>Halloween 2020</strong> and <strong>Halloween 2021</strong> were <strong>Universal</strong>, <strong>80s Slashers</strong>, <strong>Giallo</strong> and <strong>Vincent Price</strong>.  The new ones were <strong>Godzilla</strong>, <strong>Exploitation</strong>, <strong>Horror Pack</strong> and <strong>Paul Naschy</strong>.  Some highlights to me were <strong>Cemetery of Terror</strong> and <strong>Fade to Black</strong>.  Lowlights include <strong>All Monsters Attack</strong> and <strong>Psychos</strong>.  Label-wise, there were <strong>18</strong> Scream Factory (non-collectors editions) due mostly to Naschy, Universal, and Vincent Price.  There were <strong>10 </strong>Criterion, all thanks to the <strong>Godzilla</strong> portion of the list.  Also, <strong>6</strong> Vinegar Syndrome due to some slashers and gialli.  The list was heavily skewed towards older movies with the only movies after the 1980s being the <strong>5</strong> Horror Pack movies, which were 2010s.  Everything else was 1940s to 1980s.  Of course the 70s and 80s dominated with 17 and 13 respectively.  I don’t know that this group of movies was quite as memorable as the ones I got with <strong>Halloween 2020</strong>, but it was still an enjoyable experience.</li><li><strong>Days of Listmas</strong> – [<strong>36</strong> movies, <strong>6.36</strong> avg] – This was a really fun idea and I’m surprised I had the movies to make it work.  Using the 12 Days of Christmas format (but starting with 8 because starting with 12 would be 78 movies..) only works if I have enough movies of different categories to support it.  Luckily, the numbers worked out.  Of course, I relied heavily on 80s slashers yet again.  But this time I incorporated a lot of non-horror.. crime/action, sci-fi, westerns, samurai and drama.  So it ended up being a kind of genre variety watchlist too, just with a unique structure.  Some highlights: <strong>In Search of Darkness – Part II</strong>, <strong>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</strong> and <strong>Kagemusha</strong>.  Some lowlights: <strong>Fright Night 2: New Blood</strong> and <strong>Ninja III: The Domination</strong>.  The labels were spread pretty evenly with slightly more Arrow, but only at <strong>7</strong>.  The list spanned years from the 1960s to the 2020s, but nothing for the 2000s.  As you can guess, the 1980s dominated with <strong>17</strong> movies, almost half the entire list.  Overall, it was a fairly high-rated list for me and a fun little experiment</li><li><strong>Blood!</strong> – [<strong>28</strong> movies, <strong>5.23</strong> avg] – That average rating should tell the story of this list.  It was a loose theme where any movie with “Blood” somewhere in the title made the list.  This was any format.. VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray.  I was able to categorize them into groups of 4 as well, making 7 groups.  I suspect many movies used titles with “Blood” in them just to catch eyes and increase sales because the movies themselves didn’t have much going for them.  The only highlight here was <strong>The Bloodhound</strong> and there were many lowlights, but I’ll just point to one in particular <strong>Backwoods Bloodbath: Curse of Black Hodag</strong>, which, so far, is my lowest rated movie out of the 500 with a rating of <strong>2</strong>(!).  Labels, Severin had the most with <strong>9</strong> due to Al Adamson, Andy Milligan and some horror from the Philippines.  Years, we spanned  from the 1960s to 2020s, hitting each decade in between at least once.  One fun memory I had with this was a trio of slashers on Jan 8.  None of them were good, but it was kind of a fun way to spend most of a day.  Probably the lowest quality watchlist I’ve had so far, but I still have some positive memories</li><li><strong>March Madness 2</strong> – [<strong>32</strong> movies, <strong>5.81</strong> avg] – I really enjoyed the original <strong>March Madness</strong> and couldn’t wait to do it again.  This time the movie selections were a lot weaker overall.  The winner was <strong>A Field in England</strong>, but it wasn’t that strong of a winner.  Another highlight was <strong>The Fifth Cord</strong>.  The lowlights were <strong>Psychos in Love</strong> and <strong>Wacko</strong>, both comedic 80s slashers that just weren’t funny at all to me.  Again, Severin had the most with <strong>9</strong> movies.  There seems to be a correlation.. the more Severin in a list, the lower the list rating.. but the funny thing is that Severin actually had a few of the stronger movies this time thanks to the Folk Horror set.  The years spanned from the 1960s to 2010s, again with each decade hit.  The process was still fun and the big takeaway for me was that I enjoyed these Folk Horror movies, but it was definitely weaker than the original <strong>March Madness</strong>.  I hope to do another one this spring, fingers crossed that I get a little bit better selection</li><li><strong>The Missing Years</strong> – [<strong>23</strong> movies, <strong>6.65</strong> avg] – Just for the sake of completionism, I felt the urge to fill in some gaps in years where I didn’t have a single watched movie.  I decided to start at 1920 and find a movie for each unwatched year, which left me with <strong>23</strong> movies.  The shortest list this year but still a reasonably sized list.  The highlights were <strong>The Gold Rush</strong> and <strong>A Face in the Crowd</strong>.  The lowlight was <strong>The Broadway Melody</strong>.  This time, the boutique labels weren’t really a factor except for <strong>4 </strong> Criterion and <strong>2</strong> Kino Lorber.  The big contributor was the Warner Bros 100 Film Set with <strong>8</strong> movies.  Of course, this list was heavily skewed for the early years since I had not watched any movies pre-1931 for any lists so far.  We had 1920s-1950s, then a jump to the 1970s and then another jump to the 2000s.  Overall, it was an interesting list, but it was a little hard to watch so many old movies back-to-back.  They’re generally good for what they are but definitely dated and makes for a harder viewing experience for me.</li><li><strong>ABCs of Horror</strong> – [<strong>26</strong> movies, <strong>5.88</strong> avg] – Another loose theme, this time just finding a horror movie for each letter of the alphabet.  I happened to have enough movies to cover these except for Q and X, which meant I had to order a couple to make it work.  Another pretty weak watchlist for my personal ratings, but the highlights were <strong>Tales of the Uncanny</strong> and <strong>The Stylist</strong>.  Lowlight was <strong>Fatal Exam</strong>.  Again, a really even spread across labels.  Years were 1950s to 2020s with each decade hit in between.  It was a good mix of sub-genres, with typical stuff like slashers, gialli and sci-fi horror.  Also a mix of psychos, supernatural and even a bit of zombies.  But all in all, it wasn’t a super cohesive list, but just another fun structure</li><li><strong>Backloggin</strong> – [<strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>5.72</strong> avg] – There wasn’t really a “theme” here, other than finding a bunch of stuff in my backlog that still hadn’t been watched.  So it was more of a cleanup duty than anything.  As with the ABCs, it was pretty weak.  The highlight was <strong>Ponyo</strong> which was good, even though it isn’t one of my favorite Ghibli movies.  The lowlight was <strong>Witchtrap</strong>.  The non-collectors edition Scream Factory movies were slightly in the lead with <strong>6</strong>, but not that much more than other labels.  Years were 1950s to 2010s with all decades in between.  It felt good to get some of these old movies cleaned up and gave me a good excuse to pull some of these random movies off the shelf.  But now this was three lists in a row that had no real cohesive theme or grouping of the movies, so it had started to feel a little too random</li><li><strong>Genres 2</strong> – [<strong>30</strong> movies, <strong>6.73</strong> avg] – Just like I did the previous year, I decided to have a non-horror list dedicated to specific genres.  As before, I had one for <strong>Western</strong>, <strong>Action</strong>, <strong>Drama</strong> and <strong>Adventure</strong>.  The difference this year was adding <strong>Comedy</strong> and <strong>Martial Arts</strong> and not having a dedicated <strong>Sci-Fi</strong> category.  Overall, the ratings were a little weaker compared to the Year One <strong>Genres</strong> list, mostly because the action movies this time were kind of bad.  The highlights of the list were <strong>Glengarry Glen Ross</strong> and <strong>The Northman</strong>.  The lowlight was <strong>Hard Ticket to Hawaii</strong>.  This was a big-time Arrow list with <strong>14</strong> movies.. almost half the list.  I hadn’t really even realized that until now.. but it makes sense with the Shaw Brothers set, the Tsukamoto movies and some scattered other movies.  This was 1960s through 2020s with all decades in between.  It was nice to have some categories again to kind of get into a rhythm of one style of movie for a few days before switching gears.  Of course the drama movies were pretty good, but I was pleasantly surprised by the comedies too.  A strong way to end Year Two for sure</li>",

      "Ok maybe time to wrap this up and go into hibernation for a week before the big Halloween season starts.  I’ve already talked about the lists, years, labels, categories and ratings, so I think all that’s left for me to talk about are some individual movies.  Of course, I have to do a top 10 and a bottom 10 with some honorable mentions, then maybe some specific mentions.",
      "<strong>Top 10</strong>",
      "Instead of basing this on pure numerical ratings, I want to go with my gut now after I’ve had some time to digest all of the movies.  So, ratings-wise, these might not line up, but oh well..",
      "<li><strong>Marriage Story</strong> – Interesting to see two sides of a conflict.  It’s sad but there’s humor in the movie and it’s well acted</li><li><strong>The Editor</strong> – I started off not super impressed, but as the movie went on and I started to get the references and the humor, I started to really appreciate it</li><li><strong>A Dark Song</strong> – A great slow burn.  It’s weird and creepy and I really enjoy the setting of this big old house somewhere in northern UK I think…?</li><li><strong>Roma</strong> – Again, I was underwhelmed at first, mainly due to the hype it had.  I always read “Roma should have won best pictures, this is an outrage, rabble rabble rabble”, so I expected to be amazed.  In the end, it made a good impression on me, but it took some time to get used to its pace and “uneventful” storytelling</li><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – I’ve said before that, maybe if I watch it again in a different time and setting, I would be less impressed.  But still.. the memory I do have of watching this is good</li><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – If there was such a category as “dramatic horror” or something like that, this is it.  It’s a little psychological, mental and emotional horror more than anything outright, but I “got” it, even if the main character is in a much different life situation than me, it’s still relatable</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – Another one that’s more dramatic and more of a personal story than some obvious horror.  Great setting with 90s NYC, and not the “touristy” parts of NYC</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – I’m going to go ahead and toss this one in.  When thinking back on all the movies I watched, in terms of just how fun the experience was, this is up there.  It’s campy and I had to get used to that, but once I embraced the campyness, it all came together</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – This is a tough one only because I feel like there were some pieces missing that could have really tied the room together and made this even better.  Still, as is, it’s go Al Pacino and a very interesting look at a real sub-culture in that distinct early 80s NYC atmosphere.  And it’s very slasher-like, which is a plus for me</li><li><strong>Dirty Harry</strong> – The standard for the “plays-by-his-own-rules” cop kind of movie.  Maybe it’s been overdone at this point, but this one was a fun watch for me</li>",
      "The first seven or so on that list were pretty easy to pick.  They had been on my mind as top movies for a while.  But the last three, I really had to look at the list and decide.. but I think I made the right choices..",
      "<strong>Honorable Mentions</strong>",
      "In no particular order..",
      "<li><strong>Idle Hands</strong> – Too goofy for a Top 10 spot for me, but it’s harmless fun that takes place on Halloween and it scratches the late-90s teen movie itch that I have sometimes, being a late-90s teen myself</li><li><strong>Phenomena</strong> – Dario Argento’s giallo sensibilities fused with slasher tropes and supernatural powers.. what else can there be in life?</li><li><strong>The El Duce Tapes</strong> – It’s gross, a little disturbing and insane.. but super fascinating to me.  I don’t think it glorifies the disgusting nature of the subject(s), otherwise it’d be a harder watch for me because.. like I said.. they are pretty gross</li><li><strong>The Ides of March</strong>– Maybe it’s because I’m fairly fresh off of watching this one, but it’s a great cast, great visuals and smart writing (at least from my dumb not-politically-savvy perspective)</li>",
      "<strong>Bottom 10</strong>",
      "Again, maybe the ratings won’t line up, but looking back, here are the ones that just left me feeling like “why was this a movie?”",
      "<li><strong>Devil’s Due</strong> – Unoriginal, found footage, bad acting, bad writing, bad bad</li><li><strong>A Brush with Death</strong> – It’s cool that basically anyone can make a movie these days, but that doesn’t mean what they make will be good at all and this is a perfect example</li><li><strong>Harvest of Fear</strong> – Same as above, but only slightly better because it has a bit of a Halloween/autumn thing going on</li><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – Not only is it basically just a <strong>Gamera</strong> clip show, but it’s clips of some already fairly mediocre movies.  It’s like a greatest hits album where the hits aren’t hits and they aren’t really great</li><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – My only real memories of this was that it was poorly made and the Dracula actor was awkward and constantly blinking</li><li><strong>Psycho a Go-Go</strong> – Maybe more of a “movie” than <strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong>, but not really interesting to me.  I guess I’m not into that 60s “thriller” style with all the 60s flat top haircuts</li><li><strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – If you took out the last three minutes of the movie.. what would you have?  Just a movie called “The Woman” I guess</li><li><strong>Brain of Blood</strong> – I only remember finding this one super boring..</li><li><strong>The Apparition</strong> – An example of 2010s supernatural horror aimed at a teen audience… which is not a subgenre I’m a big fan of</li><li><strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation</strong> – Really just a cult movie disguised as a <strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night</strong> movie.  All I wanted for Christmas was a Christmas-themed horror movie and I didn’t get it 😦</li>",
      "<strong>Dishonorable Mentions</strong>",
      "Of course, there are many other pretty bad movies, but here are just a handful (again, in no order):",
      "<li><strong>Mirrors 2</strong> – Another cheap 2010s supernatural horror.  Most movies in that camp already have an uphill battle with me, even if I want to like the movies I own/watch</li><li><strong>The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</strong> – I can’t imagine anyone really finding this movie appealing or funny and it’s not really a horror so.. who is the target audience?</li><li><strong>Horror of the Blood Monsters</strong> – Maybe this should have been in the actual Top 10.. it’s so disjointed and weird, but maybe that’s what make its memorable.  A weird kind of unintentional “art”</li><li><strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – I’ve been dissing on this movie ever since I watched it, but it’s just almost cringingly unfunny</li>",
      "<strong>Other Mentions</strong>",
      "Those are the standard top/bottom 10.. but what about some other superlatives (excluding movies I already mentioned above):",
      "<li><strong>Most Surprising</strong> – <strong>No Telling</strong> – This should be for Larry Fessenden movies as a whole.  For some reason, I thought he was more of a schlocky b-movie type filmmaker, which I was prepared for.. I wasn’t prepared for something more artistic with a lot of philosophical dialog</li><li><strong>Most Disappointing</strong> – <strong>Ghost Story</strong> – Maybe this is my own fault with a case of different expectations.  I had it in my head that this was more of a historical New England type ghost story (based on the poster), so I was really looking forward to that.  What I got instead was fine.. but a bit of a let-down</li><li><strong>Most Confusing </strong>– <strong>Slaughterhouse Five</strong> – It’s a hard one to follow.  It’s an interesting idea, but you’re being whipped around to so many different times and places..</li><li><strong>Most Unique</strong> – <strong>The Wedding Party</strong> – In a year of slashers, monsters, dramas, westerns, crime thrillers and ghosts.. there was one movie that was a a semi-silent film, black and white and a comedy.  While it wasn’t really my style of movie, it was definitely different from everything else in the list</li><li><strong>Most Forgettable</strong> – <strong>Black Friday</strong> – Even after re-reading my thoughts on this movie, I really don’t remember anything about it</li>",
      "<strong>Other Thoughts</strong>",
      "It was a fun year of movies and lists.  I had some fun memories of watching these and they put a timestamp on different points of the year.  For instance, I watched several of the 60s movies for the <strong>Decades of Horror</strong> list while at my parents house dogsitting.  Seeing those projected on a big screen in my dad’s movie room was kind of weird.. These old lower quality movies are not the greatest use of a projector.  Seeing the gaps in the movies reminds me of some trips I took over the year, too.  So it’s a great way to log a year in my life, even if the focus is just the movies themselves",
      "So what’s next.. well, I don’t know if I mentioned it 2000 times or not yet, but Halloween is coming up.  I’ve got a list planned out, so I’m ready for that.  I still have a lot of unwatched blu-rays to get through, so that will usually be my focus as the lists go.  But I do want to check out some of these random VHS tapes I have.  The only issue is whether the tapes have degraded too much to even be watchable.  So it may be harder to plan for those without knowing which tapes will be good.  I’ll figure something out though..",
      "Anyway, I’m really happy how this blog experiment has worked out.  Growing up, I was never a fan of the idea of having a journal. It always seemed so strange to me and in shows and movies, peoples journals/diaries were always found with some incriminating evidence or something.. so it always just seemed like a bad idea to keep those around.  Now that I’m older, I appreciate the idea of documenting your experiences for your future self.  In the beginning, I talked to “Future Me” in these posts and now that’s me.. I am Future Me!  But there will be more Future Me’s, so I’ll keep logging these movies and having fun with it",

      "Aside from the memories of watching the movies and being able to look back at my thoughts about the movies months/years later, I also enjoy gathering the rating data.  I wouldn’t say my ratings are exactly scientific or based on legitimate film study.  I’m not a critic at all, and to be fair, there are some movies where I don’t give them enough focus while watching because I get sidetracked with something else.  So I mostly go with my gut instinct to the movie and then adjust a little based on some technical aspects.  For instance, an old Universal movie might leave me feeling a little underwhelmed but I might bump the rating a little bit because I understand its place in history or that it was probably pretty impressive for its era.  Anyway, that’s my primer on ratings.  Now the first thing to look at is the distribution of ratings over all 250 movies:",

      "Maybe a little hard to see, but there are two small spikes at 6 and 7.  The whole graph is basically a bell curve that centers around 6.5.  Oddly, there is a dip at 6.5, though.  This distribution is pretty similar to when I posted at the 6 month point, so no surprises here.  A few notes about that chart:",
      "<li>Very few movies on either edge.  It’s not often that I’ll really dislike a movie because I feel most of the movies I watch are at least entertaining or interesting for some reason.  It also takes a lot for me to be really impressed by a movie and sometimes it takes time and rewatches before something really sticks with me.  So below 4 and above 8 is a pretty rare area.  Luckily there were no “Woah..” bad movies..yet.  I’m actually not sure what a movie would have to do to be so low.. maybe a movie that promotes terrible things, like some kind of overt racist propaganda movie or something..</li><li>That dip at 6.5.. I guess I tend to think “did I like this movie or was this movie just above average” so I end up going between a 7 and a 6 while 6.5 ends up being a bit of a no-man’s land.  It’s not a huge dip though.. 10 or so more movies in that bucket and this would look more “bell”-like</li><li>Only one movie landed in the “Amazing” range, but I’ll get more into my favorites in the next post! </li>",
      "So there’s the distribution.  All told, the average comes to <strong>6.17</strong> out of <strong>10</strong>.  I’m probably a little more generous to these movies due to my cheesy horror bias, but there are also a decent amount of dramas and westerns that I generally rated 7 or above that help bring the numbers up a little.  If we’re talking about purely horror, the numbers would probably be a bit lower, maybe closer to 6.  But speaking of overrating some movies…",
      "<strong>My ratings compared to other ratings</strong>",
      "This is what I was really looking forward to talking about.  I try to rate movies with my own perspective, not clouded by what other people think or say about a movie.  I make a point not to read reviews or ratings of the movies I’m about to watch until I’ve made my own post and rating.  There are a few times when I already know the general consensus of a movie and I think that does affect my judgment a little.",
      "So what I did was write a little script to scrape data from Letterboxd to gather up all of the average user ratings for each of the movies I watched in my lists, and then compared them to my own.  What I found was pretty interesting.. the distribution looked like this:",
      "<li><strong>Way Underrated</strong>– <strong>6</strong> movies – This means my score was at least 1.5 (out of 10) under the average user rating</li><li><strong>Underrated</strong> – <strong>58</strong> movies – My score was 0.26 to 1.49 under</li><li><strong>Barely Underrated</strong> – <strong>21</strong> movies – My score was 0.11 to 0.25 under</li><li><strong>Close</strong> – <strong>28</strong> movies – My score was within 0.10 under/over</li><li><strong>Barely Overrated</strong> – <strong>15</strong> – My score was 0.11 to 0.25 over</li><li><strong>Overrated</strong> – <strong>107</strong> movies – My score was 0.26 to 1.49 over</li><li><strong>Way Overrated</strong> – <strong>15</strong> movies – My score was 1.5 or more higher</li>",
      "Yeah very nerdy.  But it’s interesting.. I basically double on the overrated/way overrated categories than I am underrated/way underrated.  I suppose it has to do with what I mentioned before, about having a predisposition too cheesy horror that means I’ll go a little higher on movies than the average person will.  I think it would be interesting to look at the most underrated and most overrated (and maybe the most closely rated) movies.. so here we go:",
      "<strong>Movies I Underrated</strong>",

      "<li><strong>Harvest of Fear (2004)</strong> – [<strong>3.00 </strong>vs <strong>5.62</strong>, diff: <strong>-2.62</strong>] – I honestly didn’t get how this has such a relatively high rating until I looked at Letterboxd and it’s like 40ish reviews total so maybe it’s just the people who worked on the movie or knew people in the movie.  I think a 3 on this was already a bit generous..</li><li><strong>Road Games (1981)</strong> – [<strong>5.00</strong> vs <strong>7.06</strong>, diff: <strong>-2.06</strong>] – I guess I really missed the mark here.  For some reason, I just remember the movie not being very exciting or fun, but maybe I just wasn’t in the right mindset that day.  Maybe worth a rewatch</li><li><strong>Psycho a Go-Go (1965)</strong> – [<strong>3.50</strong> vs <strong>5.38</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.88</strong>] – I’m surprised people would be so tolerant of this.  I guess it’s semi-coherent compared to some other Al Adamson movies, but it’s still not good by any means</li><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein (1971)</strong> – [<strong>3.00</strong> vs <strong>4.74</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.74</strong>] – Again, I’m surprised this is even close to a 5 in Letterboxd world.  I have to believe some people appreciate it in an ironic way, like a “so bad it’s good”..</li><li><strong>The Wizard of Gore (1970)</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong> vs <strong>5.70</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.70</strong>] – I guess I was a little harder on this one because it felt a little aimless.  I get that gore effects were kind of novel at the time, but as a <em>movie</em>, it’s not much</li><li><strong>The Invisible Woman (1940)</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong> vs <strong>5.52</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.52</strong>] – I stand by my 4.. the attempts at comedy were embarrassingly bad and there was no horror to be found</li><li><strong>A Brush with Death</strong> <strong>(2007)</strong> – [<strong>3.00</strong> vs <strong>4.38</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.38</strong>] – Probably another instance of a low sample size, but at least this is a little closer to what I expected compared to <strong>Harvest of Fear</strong>..</li><li><strong>Dracula’s Daughter (1936)</strong> – [<strong>5.00</strong> vs <strong>6.34</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.34</strong>] – I only remember being disappointed that there was no actual Dracula and just finding the movie a general “ehh..”.  Maybe I should rewatch it and give it another chance, but many of these Universal sequels didn’t do much for me the first time around</li><li><strong>Gods and Generals (2003)</strong> – [<strong>4.00</strong> vs <strong>5.34</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.34</strong>] – Maybe this should be more like a 5 for me but I was pretty put off by the overall movie, I had to come in a little lower</li><li><strong>Paranoiac (1963)</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong> vs <strong>6.82</strong>, diff: <strong>-1.32</strong>] – I’m surprised this is fairly highly rated for a random 60s horror movie.  I thought it was just ok, but then again, I guess I tend to come in a little low for a lot of pre-70s movies just based on my own personal movie tastes</li>",

Maybe a little slow, but this is one of those times where I go a bit higher out of appreciation for what it did for its time</li><li><strong>Deep Rising (1998)</strong> – [<strong>6.00</strong> vs <strong>6.02</strong>, diff: <strong>-0.02</strong>] – Exactly what you’d expect.. some mindless horror/action/sci-fi from the late 90s.  Not going to amaze people but it’s fun</li><li><strong>The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1982)</strong> – [<strong>5.50</strong> vs <strong>5.48</strong>, diff: <strong>0.02</strong>] – A very average, not super memorable, 80s slasher.  People who take the time to watch it are probably into 80s slashers already, so will go a little bit above a 5, but not much</li><li><strong>Don’t Go in the Woods (1981)</strong> – [<strong>4.50</strong> vs <strong>4.48</strong>, diff: <strong>0.02</strong>] – Just like <strong>The Dorm That Dripped Blood</strong>, but a point lower.

I thought at worst, users would be in the mid 6s here.. but I guess if someone is looking for horror, there’s not much pure horror here.  But the atmosphere was right for me.. maybe because I watched this in mid-February, right after we had a big snowstorm so it was just a right place, right time sort of thing for me</li><li><strong>Devil (2010)</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.12</strong>, diff: <strong>2.38</strong>] – Maybe I came in a bit too high here, but I just remember being kind of pleasantly surprised.  So maybe it was a case of low expectations.  It’s a fun premise but with some really awkward exposition.  I can see why people would come in a little lower, especially with the M. Night Shyamalan connection, people expect bigger things</li><li><strong>Species (1995)</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.26</strong>, diff: <strong>2.24</strong>] – This is probably as close to a guilty pleasure as it gets on this list for me.  It was fun 90s cheese with that 90s CGI stank at a time when I was looking for that nostalgia.  If I ever rewatch it, I may find it wasn’t as fun as that first time</li><li><strong>Teen Wolf Too (1987)</strong> – [<strong>6.00</strong> vs <strong>3.80</strong>, diff: <strong>2.20</strong>] – I know this isn’t a good movie, but it’s decently fun 80s comedy.  I really can’t believe the average is SO low.. it’s unusual for any movie to be this low on Letterboxd, so I really don’t get it.  Again, this is one where my judgment was clouded by knowing just how low the rating was, so I probably came in a little higher out of being surprised the movie wasn’t AS bad as I expected</li><li><strong>The Editor (2014)</strong> – [<strong>8.50</strong> vs <strong>6.46</strong>, diff: <strong>2.04</strong>] – I was a fan of this one.  It won the March Madness tournament!  The average ratings aren’t super low, but I suspect a lot of people who watched this may not have a fondness for giallos or get those funny little references, so I can get a “not bad” kind of rating from more neutral viewers</li><li><strong>Critters 4 (1992)</strong> – [<strong>6.00</strong> vs <strong>4.08</strong>, diff: <strong>1.92</strong>] – I’m not sure I have a defense for this one.  It’s <strong>Critters</strong> in Space so already it’s pretty absurd.  But taking it for what it was, I had some fun.  It’s fun if you don’t take it seriously, but who was taking the <strong>Critters</strong> series seriously in the first place?</li><li><strong>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</strong> – [<strong>8.00</strong> vs <strong>6.12</strong>, diff: <strong>1.88</strong>] – Yeah maybe an 8 is a little high, but I guess I just found the fact that a big blockbuster movie actually had some good humor and the CGI was decently done</li><li><strong>Incarnate (2016)</strong> – [<strong>6.00</strong> vs <strong>4.14</strong>, diff: <strong>1.86</strong>] – I am kind of surprised I even came in at a 6.  I think I gave it the benefit of the doubt because of an ok cast.. but when I think back on the movie, I remember the goofy pseudo-science and the overly serious tone.  So yeah, I admittedly was a little too high on this movie</li><li><strong>The Last Winter (2006)</strong> – [<strong>7.50</strong> vs <strong>5.64</strong>, diff: <strong>1.86</strong>] – I guess I don’t really see eye-to-eye with most users on Larry Fessenden.  I feel like all his movies have been good and, even though this wasn’t my favorite of his, I enjoyed it</li><li><strong>Hearts in Atlantis (2001)</strong> – [<strong>8.00</strong> vs <strong>6.16</strong>, diff: <strong>1.84</strong>] – Could be seen as slow or uneventful to some, but I’m a Stephen King fan and I appreciated the classic Stephen King drama style with some small connections to the Stephen King “universe”</li>",
      "I’ll stop there with 10.. but I was pretty high on a lot of other movies too.  It’s hard for movies on Letterboxd to be 4+ in their average rating, so anytime I go up to an 8 or higher, I’m typically going to be over the average user rating.  I don’t mind being a bit more generous about ratings.. I go into movies hoping to like them and don’t typically jump on any hate bandwagons around a movie.",
      "Anyway, there are a few movies that maybe I need to re-evaluate.  But overall, it’s interesting to me to see these trends and I don’t mind that I go way over or under on some movies.. that’s what makes my ratings unique and personalized.  It’s not about trying to “guess” what the average user rates a movie when I make my rating, although sometimes it is validating to see that others liked/disliked a movie that you did as well.  But for now, that’s all I have to say about ratings..",

    content: [
      "What does “category” mean?  Well my own made-up definition in this context is just whatever I feel like calling a certain group of movies.  Not exactly a genre, sometimes it’s a sub-genre, sometimes it’s a country, sometimes it’s movies from one actor.  Here are some notable categories I’ve been tracking:",
      "<li><strong>80s Slashers</strong> – <strong>16</strong> movies, <strong>5.75/10</strong> avg rating – 80s slashers are an easy go-to for these watchlists.  I have a lot of them and I haven’t seen too many of them.  I’m a <strong>Halloween</strong> and <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> guy, and of course I love the 80s, so 80s slashers, on paper, is right up my alley.  In practice, a lot of these lesser known slashers are rough.  It’s still a form of comfort food, but when I rate them, I try to mix in a little objectivity with my subjectivity.  That means most of these slashers ended up in pretty mediocre territory for me<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Phenomena</strong> – Less slashery than others, but a better movie too</li><li><strong>Amsterdamned</strong> – Great location</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Don’t Go in the Woods</strong> – As I’ve said before, just low quality all around</li><li><strong>Splatter University</strong> – Also low quality, especially the visual quality</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Action</strong> – <strong>12</strong> movies, <strong>6.75/10</strong> avg rating – I’m not so much of an action guy.  Maybe that’s weird.. but I don’t usually get the excitement from action scenes that you’re supposed to get.  I made it a point to watch some action movies in these watchlists, especially some more classic action movies that I probably should have seen by now but just hadn’t.  In the end, I was pretty happy with them<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Dirty Harry</strong> – This guy’s a loose cannon</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – What a wild experience</li><li><strong>Lethal Weapon</strong> – The most classic of buddy cop movies</li><li><strong>The Fugitive</strong> – Has a bit of a journey to it, which I like</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Dolan’s Cadillac</strong> – Is this action..?  I don’t know, but I put it there.  It’s just kind of.. meh</li><li><strong>The New Barbarians / 1990: The Bronx Warriors</strong> – A 2-for-1.  The are cheesy fun but not exactly <em>good</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Comedy Horror</strong> – <strong>10</strong> movies, <strong>6.35/10</strong> avg rating – Mixing comedy and horror is sometimes a little iffy.  It usually leans towards one or the other and if the one it leans towards is not good, then the whole thing doesn’t work.  The more common case I see is comedies that happen to be centered around a horror premise, like <strong>Shaun of the Dead</strong> <strong>(2004)</strong>.  The rarer one is a horror movie that has some legitimate humor/cleverness, like <strong>Scream (1996)</strong>.   Everything I watched in these watchlists falls into the former category, so my judgment was more about how fun/funny they were and not how horrific they were.  In the end, there were a handful of fun movies that I would definitely watch again and, just because, I’ll list all of them in my “Top” section coming up right….now<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>The Editor</strong> – More of a giallo parody, which, after watching a few more of those this year, struck me a bit more than it might others</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – More of a dark comedy, but has some actually funny stuff</li><li><strong>Idle Hands</strong> – I was skeptical of the hit-or-miss comedy in this at first, but in the end, the movie won me over</li><li><strong>Another WolfCop</strong> – Dumb but fun</li><li><strong>Elvira, Mistress of the Dark</strong> – Not so much laugh-out-loud funny as just a fun experience overall</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>The Garbage Pail Kids</strong> – Again, I don’t really know how to categorize this one, but this is the closest category I can think of.. it’s just not very good..</li><li><strong>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</strong> – I want to like its cornball humor but I just can’t..</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Drama</strong> – <strong>9</strong> movies, <strong>7.50/10</strong> avg rating – Here I am, drama snob.  Rating dramas higher than everything else.  I’m a horror fan through and through, but if we’re talking about “art”, dramas are my go-to.  Dramas can be boring, they can be Oscar-baity or they can just be bad.. bad writing, acting, you name it.  Luckily for me, I didn’t run into too much of that this time around, with (almost..) all of the movies being good or better<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Marriage Story</strong> – an “everyday life” kind of drama, nothing big or epic, but it works very well for that reason</li><li><strong>Roma</strong> – also kind of a slice of life type drama but with a more distinct time and place</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Gods and Generals</strong> – Yep, just can’t get around the overly sympathetic and heroic perspective towards the South</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Giallo</strong> – <strong>8</strong> movies, <strong>6.69/10</strong> avg rating – I’m not going to pretend like I can distinguish between giallos without re-reading my comments.  For some reason, among all sub-genres of movies, giallos are the most similar to each other for me.  I can tell the difference between 80s slashers or zombie movies pretty easily, but the giallo.. each one is very similar in its tone and style.. maybe it has a bit to do with being non-English audio?  Anyway, picking my top movies is tough because of that..<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key</strong> – I remember the settings, mostly, and I guess that’s one of the main things I look for in a giallo</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>All the Colors of the Dark</strong> – Not bad, but I just remember not being thrilled by the cult stuff</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Hammer</strong> – <strong>5</strong> movies, <strong>6.30/10</strong> avg rating – Ok, only five movies, not much to speak of, but worth noting anyway.  Hammer films have a nice classic look to them, always good historical sets and often vibrant colors.  The horror in them is fairly out-dated, understandably, so they are fun to look at but I sometimes get a little bored<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>The Phantom of the Opera</strong> – Did a good job at making you sympathize with the phantom</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Paranoiac</strong> – Not bad, but in black and white, it loses those vibrant colors I mentioned, but it does have some creepy moments</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Japanese</strong> – <strong>31</strong> movies, <strong>6.34/10</strong> avg rating – Ok, I lumped all of Japanese cinema into one bucket.  It started because I had a theme in the Halloween 2020 watchlist ust for Japanese horror.. then I watched the <strong>Gamera</strong> series, then sprinkled in other Japanese action and horror throughout the watchlists.  So I just started noticing how many Japanese films I was watching and decided to keep adding them to this overarching category.  There is a lot of variety within this umbrella, but I have to say, overall, I was pretty happy with the movies I watched<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – A very personal drama and it seemed artfully done</li><li><strong>Ringu</strong> – The original.. maybe packs less of a punch after already seeing the remake but still creepy</li><li><strong>Porco Rosso</strong> – Gotta give a little shout out to Studio Ghibli</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – Easy choice for bottom, as mentioned, it’s more or less a clip show</li><li><strong>Gamera vs Zigra</strong> – One of the goofier Gamera movies</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Sci-Fi</strong> – <strong>9</strong> movies, <strong>6.17/10</strong> avg rating – I like sci-fi and sci-fi horror, though I probably haven’t seen a ton of them.  The good ones usually bring up some interesting questions or points about society or technology.  I was hoping for some of that in these sci-fi movies, but in the end, I didn’t get as much as I hoped.<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Liquid Sky</strong> – More artsy than anything, but entertaining</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Escape From the Planet of the Apes</strong> – A little too uneventful for me, kind of sticks out like a sore thumb in the Apes series</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Sci-Fi Horror</strong> – <strong>14</strong> movies, <strong>6.14/10</strong> avg rating – The sibling to plain Sci-Fi.  I categorized these separately because I feel they are more in the horror world, but still deal with sci-fi concepts.  A lot of these movies deal with an “unknown”.. an unknown creature/alien, unknown natural phenomenon, unknown technology.. that kind of stuff.  Usually, that makes for interesting horror<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Event Horizon</strong> – A little 90s CGI, but otherwise pretty well-made</li><li><strong>War of the Worlds</strong> – Where the whole watchlist started.. a bit dated but still interesting in the context of the unknown</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – Barely sci-fi or horror.. barely anything more than an uninteresting story about a lady who wants to look younger</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Universal</strong> – <strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>6.04/10</strong> avg rating – Universal horror is about as classic as it gets.  I was able to watch a lot of these through box sets, either sequels to the big Universal monster movies, or one-offs put out by Universal throughout the 30s-50s.  While I never really “love” these movies, I have a respect for (most of) them<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Night Key</strong> – Not horror at all really, but a lot of fun</li><li><strong>Tower of London</strong> – Also not much horror, but more of a well-made historical drama</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – Terrible comedy.. I remember really disliking the butler character</li><li><strong>She-Wolf of London</strong> – I feel the female equivalent of the male monsters in these old Universal movies were just not given a good chance.  This one has nothing going on in it, barely any wolf action</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Vincent Price</strong> – <strong>8</strong> movies, <strong>6.25/10</strong> avg rating – As a fan of the Halloween season it’s hard not to like Vincent Price.  His voice just <em>sounds</em> like Halloween-time.  Maybe that’s because of Thriller.  Anyway, a lot of his movies I watched in these watchlists were the Roger Corman collaborations.  They would be fairly mediocre movies but Vincent Price elevates them just by being Vincent Price.  None of the movies were very bad, so I’ll just list the top<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>House of Wax</strong> – Actually not one of the Corman ones, but a good creepy premise and killer</li><li><strong>The Masque of the Red Death</strong> – Watching this plague-related movie in 2020 hits differently</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Western</strong> – <strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.91/10</strong> avg rating – Westerns are interesting.. the settings are always very similar.. geographically that makes sense.  The stories are usually similar, either about money or revenge or protection.  Yet somehow, there have been hundreds or maybe thousands of Westerns made over the years.  I guess there’s something in the simplicity that appeals to people like me.  Who knows, but I liked this group of Westerns and didn’t dislike a single one<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>The Alamo</strong> – A little Americanized history, I know, but I still enjoy the movie for what it is</li><li><strong>Giant</strong> – Kind of structured like <strong>Gone With the Wind (1939)</strong> but on a Texas ranch</li></ul></li></ul></li>",
      "Maybe as these lists go on, I’ll break these categories out a bit more.  Some movies are hard to classify, but I think it’s interesting to find similar movies that I watched and compare my thoughts within that grouping.  I expect more from a lot of these categories in the coming months as well..",

    content: [
      "Labels?  Labels?  We’re talkin bout labels?  What does that even mean.. well, as an avid collector of movies, I’ve really gotten into different boutique labels, like Arrow and Scream Factory.  These kinds of labels are great at releasing good transfers of genre movies, like “crappy” horror from the 80s, with a lot of special features.  It’s gotten to the point that I rarely buy movies if they aren’t put out by one of these labels because they usually don’t have any special features.  So of course, most of the movies I watched for this blog were from these various labels and I thought it’d be worth diving deeper and looking at them in more detail.. so here we go:",
      "<li><strong>Scream Factory</strong> – <strong>63</strong> movies, <strong>6.24/10</strong> avg rating – Scream Factory is probably my favorite of the labels, so I’m not surprised I watched the most movies from this label.  Almost exclusively horror (Shout Factory is the non-horror parent).  Their Collectors Editions are what hooked me at the start, but their sets and the various other releases and double features are great too.  They recently put out the entire <strong>Friday the 13th</strong> series in one set and they’ve released a lot of Universal and Vincent Price sets as well.  If you want to break the numbers down further, <strong>17</strong> of these were Collectors Editions, <strong>30</strong> came from sets and the remaining <strong>16</strong> were just one-off releases.  I really enjoyed the Larry Fessenden set and got a lot of mileage out of their Universal sets.<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – As I mentioned before, it’s the mood</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – More Fessenden, what a coincidence</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – The more I think about it, the more I want to rewatch it someday</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</strong> – Gross</li><li><strong>Dracula’s Daughter</strong> – Boring</li><li><strong>Curse of the Fly</strong> – No fly</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Arrow</strong> – <strong>59</strong> movies, <strong>6.31/10</strong> avg rating – Arrow is awesome.  Their releases aren’t as schlocky as you might expect.  They have some well-known movies like <strong>RoboCop (1987)</strong>, but also specialize in giallos, Japanese horror and action and lesser known horror movies.  They also have some awesome sets, like a George Romero set of some earlier movies of his and the <strong>Sartana</strong> and <strong>Outlaw</strong> series.  Arrow is almost up there with Scream Factory and, judging by the number of movies watched, they are really similar.<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – I remember it being a very raw drama</li><li><strong>The El Duce Tapes</strong> – Gross, but good</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – Dark and also raw, but maybe in a different way..</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – The clip show</li><li><strong>The Wizard of Gore</strong> – Pretty incohesive</li><li><strong>Gamera vs Zigra</strong> – A little too goofy for me</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Severin</strong> – <strong>13</strong> movies, <strong>4.73/10</strong> avg rating – Well.. this average rating is way below the others and that’s due to the Al Adamson set that they released.  I think the set is very cool, but the movies are rough.  But it’s still an experience.  They released some other random cheesy stuff too, so the quality is not too high, but I had some fun with them.<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Blood &amp; Flesh: The Reel Life &amp; Ghastly Death of Al Adamson</strong> – An interesting documentary about the man himself</li><li><strong>Wax Mask</strong> – Italian horror from the 90s with a little bit of the giallo sensibility</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – Pretty poor all around</li><li><strong>Psycho a Go-Go</strong> – Also.. not really good at any aspect</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Kino Lorber</strong> – <strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>6.18/10</strong> avg rating – I don’t go out of my way to collect these KL titles, but when I see one that looks mildly interesting, I go for it.  They’ve released some Vincent Price movies, so that accounts for a few, but they’ve also been putting out some releases with slipcovers recently and I am a sucker for those<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>Lost Highway</strong> – mysterious and confusing, but it’s Lynch</li><li><strong>Two Mules for Sister Sara</strong> – A Clint Eastwood buddy western where he isn’t just the quiet mysterious stranger</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Nightmare Beach</strong> – Not terrible, but just a run-of-the-mill 80s slasher when the slasher craze had basically ended</li><li><strong>Burnt Offerings</strong> – Had potential but was just a little too slow to reel me in</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Vinegar Syndrome</strong> – <strong>11</strong> movies, <strong>5.95/10</strong> – Like Severin, they specialize more in schlock and sleaze.  However, the group of movies I watched this year were actually not too bad.  Some giallos, thanks to their Forgotten Gialli sets and a good number of 80s slashers<ul><li>Top<ul><li><strong>The Police are Blundering in the Dark</strong> – With a name like that, you know it’s a giallo</li><li><strong>Graduation Day</strong> – A very traditional slasher from early in the 80s</li></ul></li><li>Bottom<ul><li><strong>Don’t Go in the Woods</strong> – A pretty cheap slasher without much production quality</li><li><strong>Splatter University</strong> – Ditto</li></ul></li></ul></li>",
      "That’s it for labels with 10+ movies.. but as for other labels, there were:",
      "<li><strong>Blue Underground</strong> – <strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>6.42/10</strong> avg rating – I liked <strong>Amsterdamned</strong> while the post-apocalypstic Bronx whatever movies were fairly “eh”</li><li><strong>Criterion</strong>– <strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>7.83/10</strong> avg rating – Criterion puts out legitimately great movies, so the rating is no surprise.  I liked each of these, but my favorite was <strong>Marriage Story</strong></li><li><strong>MVD</strong> – <strong>3</strong> movies, <strong>5.17/10</strong> avg rating – This one is a little new on my radar.  I see them in the store sometimes and they are usually more action-oriented than horror.  I thought <strong>Abominable</strong> was ok.. <strong>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</strong> was not really my kind of comedy..</li><li><strong>Synapse</strong> – <strong>4</strong> movies, <strong>6.38/10</strong> avg rating – <strong>Phenomena </strong>was good, <strong>The Dorm That Dripped Blood</strong> was underwhelming</li><li><strong>Vestron</strong> – <strong>3</strong> movies, <strong>6.17/10</strong> avg rating – <strong>Shivers </strong>was good, the two <strong>Warlock</strong> sequels.. were.. fine.. I guess</li>",
      "When you look at it this way, you can see the list was dominated by Scream Factory and Arrow, making up <strong>122</strong> out of <strong>250</strong> movies, basically half.  Even the other boutique labels combined don’t even add up to either Arrow or Scream Factory.  At the time of writing this, I still have something like 46 unwatched Arrow movies in my collection, so I expect more of those to come in future lists.",
      "As long as these labels keep releasing these forgotten horror movies, I’ll keep buying them.. so hopefully that will fuel my watchlists for a while!",

      "Another thing I want to talk about is the years and decades that the movies from htese lists were released.  I’m an 80s horror fanboy and the numbers will show that to a degree.. but there were a lot of interesting things I noticed when looking closer at the numbers.  Let’s talk decades first:",
      "<li><strong>1930s</strong> – <strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>6.67/10 </strong>avg rating – Thanks to some Universal representation in several watchlists, I got a few movies in from the 30s.  While I can appreciate what they were for their time period, they are usually not the most entertaining for me here in 2021.  Still, they are good for their time.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Night Key</strong> – Boris Karloff with a comedic sidekick, what’s not to like?</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Dracula’s Daughter</strong> – I just remember it being pretty boring and that’s about it</li></ul></li><li><strong>1940s</strong> – <strong>15</strong> movies, <strong>5.70/10</strong> avg rating – Again, all Universal horror.  This time though, there were a lot of sequels, as I hit a lot through the <strong>[Horror] Finish the Series</strong> list.  The problem with the 40s, especially the sequels, is that they strayed from horror and more into comedy and action.  So not my favorite decade for horror, but Universal horror movies, mediocre sequels or not, are still a great Halloween background mood.<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Mad Ghoul</strong> – I don’t remember many details, just that it was a decently made “mad doctor controls someone to kill” type of movie</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – Ugh.. bad comedy, no horror, not very appealing to me</li></ul></li><li><strong>1950s</strong> – <strong>10</strong> movies, <strong>6.45/10</strong> avg rating – Only a pinch of Universal this decade plus a little bit of sci-fi horror and classic epics.  For horror, the 50s are the end of the “old” era and a transition into the 60s where things start to get a little more intense.  The sci-fi horror of the decade is fun cheese.  Outside of horror, the epic movies are a nice ride.. if you’ve got 3.5+ hours to spare.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Giant</strong> – Definitely an epic.. spans a lot of years and its interesting to see the change in the family over time</li><li>Bottom: <strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – Not a lot of sci-fi or horror except at the very end, so I don’t know why anyone would really want to watch this sci-fi horror movie.</li></ul></li><li><strong>1960s</strong> – <strong>38</strong> movies, <strong>6.08/10</strong> avg rating – More movies in this decade than the three previous decades combined.  But this covers a wide variety, from Vincent Price to Hammer to Gamera to Japanese outlaws to Western gunslingers to James Bond.  In horror, it’s a hard decade to categorize.  There was a lot of low-budget exploitation and the start of gore films, not exactly Academy Award-winning stuff.  Outside of horror, action and westerns are the big ones.<ul><li>Top: <strong>The Alamo</strong> – Not perfect, a kind of a rose-colored glasses situation, but it’s a fun, big western</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Psycho a Go-Go</strong> – Not really anything of technical quality here, just a bit of a mess of a story</li></ul></li><li><strong>1970s</strong> – <strong>40</strong> movies, <strong>6.03/10</strong> avg rating – Looking at the numbers, the 70s seem like just an extension of the 60s.  It’s true that a little of that cheap exploitation stuff and westerns carried over in my watchlists, but the 70s felt a lot different otherwise.  Giallos were a big part of that as well as some sci-fi, especially planets with apes on them.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Dirty Harry</strong> – Who doesn’t like seeing Clint Eastwood get justice by his own rules?</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – I don’t mean to dump all over Al Adamson all the time but.. the numbers are the numbers.. this had some rough acting and kind of nonsensical plotlines</li></ul></li><li><strong>1980s</strong> – <strong>52</strong> movies, <strong>6.04/10</strong> avg rating – Of course the 80s has the highest number of watched movies.  I would have been surprised and saddened if that wasn’t the case.  As an 80s fanboy, the higher volume of movies makes sense, but notice the average rating is not much different from the previous two decades.  As much fun as 80s slashers are in general, I watched quite a few lackluster slashers in these lists and 80s slashers made up 1/3 of this entire decade’s watchlists.  Outside of that, it was a variety of stuff, some dramas, some crime action and the return of sci-fi horror.  As much as I like 80s movies, the ones I watched here were mostly middle-of-the-road without any that really stood out.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Cruising</strong> – Missing some pieces, but still very grimey and dark</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – A Gamera clip show, basically..</li></ul></li><li><strong>1990s</strong> – <strong>40</strong> movies, <strong>6.51/10</strong> avg rating – Similar number of movies to the 60s and 70s but a noticeably higher average rating.  The 90s horror I watched were actually surprisingly fun, for the most part, even though the 90s has a bad reputation for its horror.  The Gamera trilogy of the 90s was good as well.  This was the start of the Larry Fessenden movies, all of which I like.  The decade had its cheese too, but surprisingly not too many bad films from this sample size of 40.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Habit</strong> – Only a bit of horror, but mostly a drama with NYC as the backdrop</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation</strong> – Wasn’t this supposed to be about Christmas time?</li></ul></li><li><strong>2000s</strong> – <strong>23</strong> movies, <strong>6.04/10</strong> avg rating – A much lower count.. post-2000s horror is not really my thing <em>mostly</em>, but there are some good ones.  I watched a few dramas in here as well.  The good movies balanced out some pretty bad movies and the average ratings ended up right in the middle<ul><li>Top: <strong>Wendigo</strong> – Not sure why but the mood and atmosphere hit me</li><li>Bottom: <strong>A Brush with Death</strong> – So low budget, such bad acting.. woof</li></ul></li><li><strong>2010s</strong> – <strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>6.36/10</strong> avg rating – Similar count to the 2000s but a higher rating.  This actually would have been a very strong decade if it wasn’t for some crappy supernatural horror movies dragging it down.  Modern supernatural horror is kind of a pet peeve for me.  But the good.. a couple good documentaries, some really good dramas and some fun horror comedies.<ul><li>Top: <strong>Marriage Story</strong> – Great acting, really down-to-earth story and situations</li><li>Bottom: <strong>Devil’s Due</strong> – Cheap found footage, annoyingly boring characters and unoriginal plot</li></ul></li><li><strong>2020s</strong> – <strong>1</strong> movie, <strong>7.50/10</strong> avg rating – I figured I’d include this decade, though it’s just one movie, <strong>Bill and Ted Face the Music</strong>.  It was fun for me as a fan of the originals, but also just a bit too corny.  Hopefully as the watchlists go on, I’ll be able to start working more 2020s movies.</li>",

      "<li>The highest years by movie count were <strong>1970</strong> and <strong>1972</strong>, both with <strong>10</strong> movies each.  <strong>Planet of the Apes</strong> sequels, <strong>Sartana</strong> sequels, HG Lewis and some giallos contribute to that</li><li>Expanding on that, the 5-year span of <strong>1968-1972</strong> had a total of <strong>43</strong> movies.  That’s almost 1/5 of the entire 250 watched movies coming from a 5-year span!  The movies I mentioned above make up a lot of that, plus the <strong>Outlaw</strong> series, plus a bit of Brian De Palma</li><li>There are quite a few years that have <strong>0</strong> movies: <strong>1930</strong>, <strong>1932</strong>, <strong>1934</strong>, <strong>1935</strong>, <strong>1938</strong>, <strong>1947</strong>, <strong>1948</strong>, <strong>1949</strong>, <strong>1950</strong>, <strong>1952</strong>, <strong>1954</strong>, <strong>1957</strong>, <strong>1979</strong>, <strong>2008</strong>, and <strong>2013</strong>.   I’m not surprised by the 30s, 40s and 50s, although that 1947-1950 gap is pretty noticeable.  What surprises me the most is that 1979 is missing considering that the 70s was one of the biggest decades this year for the lists.  I guess it’s just that the 70s was heavily front-loaded (only <strong>8</strong> for the last half of the decade vs <strong>32</strong> for the first half).  I’ll see what I can do to fix these empty years in future watchlists..</li>",
      "That’s about all I have to say about years and decades for now.  I’m glad I ended up with a wide distribution of years, spanning <strong>90</strong> years from <strong>1931</strong> to <strong>2020</strong>.  From the Spanish <strong>Drácula&nbsp;</strong>to <strong>Bill and Ted Face the Music</strong>.. what a wild ride.",
      "I obviously have a soft spot for the 80s and 70s, but the 90s horror surprised me in these lists.  I was glad to get a big boost in my knowledge of 60s movies.  Before these lists, I had seen roughly 80 movies from the 60s, but now have seen close to 120 thanks to these lists.  And I probably nearly doubled the number of 40s movies I’ve seen.  In general, I estimate I’ve seen about 1,930 movies in my life (probably more, but this estimate comes from browsing movies by year in Letterboxd and logging the ones I know I’ve seen in the past, plus always logging new movies that I watch).  Even if I’ve seen 2,000 movies in my life, 250 coming from just the past year is pretty wild!",
      "Anyway, I like how different years and decades have distinct styles and feels.  Sometimes it’s nice to immerse myself in an era, like with the <strong>Decades of Horror</strong> list or some of the sub-categories, like Universal, Hammer or giallos.  Because of that, year-based watchlists seem like a fun idea which I haven’t explored much, outside of <strong>Decades of Horror</strong>.  So maybe in 2022..",
      "That’s it for years/decades.. next I’ll pick up another topic to dive into!",

    title: "— Year One Summary: Part 1 – Watchlists —",
    content: [
      "Since I’m not planning on watching anymore watchlist movies until the end of August (when my Halloween season starts), I’ll consider this first year of the blog as DONE, even though it won’t <em>really</em> be one full year until around August 30th.  Shh.. ",
      "I don’t know how many parts I will make to summarize the year, but I’ll just let it play out naturally based on how many topics I think about.  I know for sure that the first thing worth talking about is the watchlists.  There were 10 total, ranging from just 6 movies to 70 (!) movies, but a typical watchlist being in the 20s.  Here are the watchlists, in order of watched, with some extra stats since I’m a nerd:",
      "<li><strong>Halloween 2020</strong> – <strong>70</strong> movies, <strong>6.01/10</strong> avg rating – Of course, being Halloween, I’m most nostalgic about this list.  The weekly structure was fun but hard to keep up for other watchlists because some weeks are just busier than others.  Squeezing X movies into one week adds a little bit of a sense of urgency to get them done before the week runs out.  The bonus movies per week was a fun idea but that only works if I have a lot of a certain category.  Some of the highlights here were <strong>A Dark Song</strong> and <strong>Kotoko</strong>.  I really enjoyed the 90s week.  Lowlights include <strong>Devil’s Due</strong>, <strong>The Apparition</strong> and several Al Adamson movies (sorry buddy..)  Other notable numbers: almost half of the movies came from the 80s and 90s (<strong>19</strong> 80s movies and <strong>11</strong> 90s movies).  <strong>24</strong> movies came from Scream Factory (non-Collectors Edition) releases and <strong>5</strong> came from the Scream Factory Collectors Editions.</li><li><strong>Nov/Dec 2020</strong> – <strong>21</strong> movies, <strong>6.10/10</strong> avg rating – Not a really clever watchlist title.  It was still theme-based, seven themes with three movies each.  This was the first time I incorporated non-horror movies as well as non-Blu Ray formats (both DVD and VHS).  It was a pretty good variety of movies, at least, and lead me through Thanksgiving up to Christmas.  Highlights were <strong>Hearts in Atlantis</strong> and <strong>Cruising</strong>.  Lowlights were <strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation </strong>and everything from the “Is it THAT bad..?” category.  They weren’t THAT bad but they were still bad, yes.  Pretty even distribution across decades, 60s to 2010s.  <strong>10</strong> movies were from Arrow, so basically half the list.  <strong>5</strong> DVDs and <strong>2</strong> VHS tapes</li><li><strong>Gamera</strong> – <strong>12</strong> movies, <strong>5.58/10</strong> avg rating – This was a lot of Gamera.. 12 movies doesn’t sound like a lot but this felt like a lot.  I slowed down the pace a bit here, starting right after Christmas but not finishing until January 20th.  Gamera movies can be fun but they are extremely repetitive.  In retrospect, maybe the best way to view these would be one or two at a time followed by some other movies to cleanse the palette.  There were still some highlights, particularly the 90s trilogy of Gamera movies, but there were lowlights too.. <strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> being the most egregious.  These were all Arrow (from the same set) and spanned releases from the 60s to the 2000s</li><li><strong>Randomizer</strong> – <strong>10</strong> movies, <strong>5.75/10</strong> avg rating – I randomly selected 10 movies, any format, and the results were..eh.  The concept is still fun and maybe I’ll do it again, but the group of movies I got had a few stinkers.  I rushed through this one.. only 10 movies, sure, but still I started January 21st and ended January 29th.  Highlights: <strong>Alien 3</strong> and <strong> Rainy Dog</strong> were pretty good, but not <em>amazing</em>.  Lowlights:<strong> The Wasp Woman</strong> and <strong>Mirrors 2</strong>.  Surprisingly, this had at least one movie from every decade from the 50s up to the 2010s.  For 10 movies randomly selected, that’s a pretty good distribution.  <strong>6</strong> blu ray, <strong>1</strong> DVD and <strong>3</strong> VHS</li><li><strong>March Madness</strong> – <strong>32</strong> movies, <strong>6.31/10</strong> avg rating – Yesss.. this one was fun.  Conceptually, the idea of pitting movies against each other was fun.  Sometimes it can be hard to rank movies personally, but when forced with a 1-on-1 challenge, I have to just pick and it’s really interesting to see which movies survive those challenges.  I decided to stick with categories here, eight categories with four movies each.  Each “region” of the bracket would have one of each category.  I definitely think I’ll try bracketed approach again, but maybe I won’t worry about categories as much.  I really rushed through these, getting all 32 movies done between February 2nd and March 7th, and that included a week+ vacation in the middle to go skiing in Colorado.  So it ended up being more of a Februrary Madness, huh.  The highlights for me were <strong>The Editor</strong>, <strong>Wendigo</strong>, <strong>Habit</strong> and <strong>Serial Mom</strong>.  The lowlights were <strong>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</strong> and several HG Lewis movies (I guess just not really my style).  Good distribution of release years, spanning all the way from the 1930s to the 2010s (except nothing from the 1950s..)  <strong>8</strong> Arrow, <strong>8 </strong>Scream Factory Collectors Editions, <strong>7</strong> Scream Factory (other) and <strong>4</strong> Vinegar Syndrome.  All blu-rays this time.</li><li><strong>Genres</strong> – <strong>25</strong> movies, <strong>7.18/10</strong> avg rating – After a pure horror (and horror comedy..) watchlist, I decided to go on a non-horror binge with a bunch of other genres, like sci-fi, western and drama.  Because of this, I ended up catching up on some classic movies I had never gotten around to seeing and watching some critically acclaimed movies.  Unsurprisingly, the average rating for this set of movies is noticeably higher than the previous watchlists.  I didn’t have too much trouble getting through these, getting them all in just under a month from March 12th to April 10th.  The highlights for me were <strong>Marriage Story</strong>, <strong>Roma</strong> and <strong>Dirty Harry</strong>.  The lowlights were really not low at all, but I found <strong>Slaughterhouse Five</strong> to be a little underwhelming, but still a decent movie.  Another good distribution of movies, 50s all the way to the 2020s.  <strong>10</strong> DVDs this time, mainly to watch some classic action, western and adventure moves from the giant DVD sets I have</li><li><strong>[Horror] Finish the Series</strong> – <strong>26</strong> movies, <strong>5.85/10</strong> avg rating – Then I went straight back to pure horror.  The idea for this watchlist came from the fact that I had so many unwatched movies from blu ray sets, like the Classic Universal Monsters set or some movie series sets put out by Scream Factory.  Getting tired of always seeing these movies in my unwatched list, I decided to just knock them all out in a list.  However, I wasn’t so committed that I felt like including the non-horror series in here as well.  It ended up being a bit of a rough watchlist.  Horror sequels are not usually known for being high quality.  It took me from April 14th to May 27th to get through these movies, but there was a trip to NYC in there somewhere.  Even though most movies weren’t great.. I did enjoy <strong>Another WolfCop</strong>.  One movie that was pretty.. meh. was <strong>She-Wolf of London</strong>.  <strong>10</strong> movies came from Scream Factory (other) sets.  There were movies from the 30s-50s, then nothing until the 80s-2010s.</li><li><strong>Decades of Horror</strong> – <strong>30</strong> movies, <strong>5.88/10</strong> avg rating – Another fun idea.  I started with 1960 and worked my way up to the present with five movies per decade, usually with a 1-3 year gap between each one to get a pretty good distribution over time.  In the end, the watchlist was not <em>great</em>, but the experience was still good.  It’s cool to see how horror evolved over 60 years.  This one took me a little bit of time to get through, from May 28th all the way up to July 11th.  Near the beginning, I was house-sitting and near the end, I spent a whole week watching SGDQ.. so those interrupted the watchlist a bit.  The highlights for me were <strong>Sisters</strong> and <strong>Shivers</strong> and the lowlights were <strong>Harvest of Fear</strong> and <strong> A Brush with Death</strong>, both terrible low-budget movies from the mid-2000s.  All blu-ray with a pretty fair distribution among labels</li><li><strong>[Non-Horror] Finish the Series</strong> – <strong>18</strong> movies, <strong>6.28/10</strong> avg rating – I had to do it.. after doing the horror version, I couldn’t leave the non-horror list undone.  Also, it was good to get back to non-horror in preparation for the upcoming Halloween 2021 watchlist.  These movies were a bit more pleasant than the horror ones, but there was a lot of repetition in some of these series.  I tried to counter that by rotating through series this time instead of finishing all of one series at once before moving onto the next.  I think it worked all right.  I got through the list in less than a month, July 14th to August 8th, and that included a few days trip to South Dakota.  The highlight for me was probably <strong>Dead or Alive 2: Birds</strong> while the lowlight was <strong>Gods and Generals</strong>.  There were <strong>10</strong> Arrow movies here, thanks to some series sets.   All the movies were between the 60s and 2000s</li><li><strong>Genre Sampler</strong> – <strong>6</strong> movies, <strong>7.58/10</strong> avg rating – A short watchlist of non-horror just to get me to 250 movies for the year.  I got to pick a few movies, one per genre, that I had been meaning to watch and, because of that, this was a very highly-rated watchlist.  I knew I had most of August to watch just six movies, so I could take my time.. but in the end, I still zoomed through, from August 9th to August 16th.  The highlights were <strong>The Ides of March</strong> and <strong>The El Duce Tapes</strong>.  The whole list was strong, so there weren’t any lowlights.  There were <strong>2</strong> DVDs here.<br></li>",
      "And that’s all of the watchlists.  Of course <strong>Halloween 2020</strong> and <strong>March Madness</strong> were my personal favorites.  They also happened to be the longest and were pure horror, which is kind of how this whole watchlist thing started for me.  My least favorites were <strong>Gamera</strong> and <strong>Randomizer</strong>.. even though there was some fun stuff in there, the quality of the movies were not so great.",
      "I rarely took much time off between watchlists, I noticed.  Of course, after the big Halloween one, I took almost two weeks off before deciding what to do next.  After that, I was always excited to get started on the next watchlist after finishing one, so I’d usually jump right in the next day or two.",
      "Looking forward to future watchlists… there are some that I can’t really do again, like the <strong>Finish the Series</strong> ones.  Now that I’ve depleted the sequels (with one exception..) from my to-do list, it would take me a while to build up a new collection of franchises on blu-ray.  There are some I’ll definitely be interested in doing again.. like <strong>March Madness</strong> or the <strong>Decades of Horror</strong> (but maybe not even just horror).  Of course I’ll always have a <strong>Halloween</strong> watchlist as long as I’m doing watchlists.  Genre samplers or randomized lists maybe.. those are my fallbacks if I can’t find a better idea.",
      "Speaking of ideas, like all cool kids, I have a spreadsheet with some ideas already mapped out.  I think I know my list for Halloween as well as the list after that.  Maybe even another short list after that… so I should be good on ideas for a while.  As I buy more movies (always..), I’ll have more and more possibilities too.",
      "Anyway, that wraps it up for the watchlist-specific discussion.  There are other things to talk about too with numbers/ratings, decades, labels, all that good stuff..",

    content: [
      "It’s been just over six months (Aug 31 – Mar 7) since I started this experiment and it’s been surprisingly enjoyable for a number of reasons.. it’s fun coming up with watchlists, actually watching the movies, jotting down some thoughts and going back and re-reading those thoughts weeks and months later.  Another guilty pleasure of mine is the stats.. so it seems like a good time to look back at the first six months of this blog and take a look at some stats, some highlights, some lowlights and just other observations.  Time to nerd out!",
      "<strong>My Ratings</strong>",
      "First, I’ve been thinking about my rating system and what the numbers mean, so I’ll go ahead and try to “formalize” it a little (zzzzz..):",
      "<strong>10</strong> – These are reserved for my very favorite movies.  There’s no such thing as a “perfect” movie but this is as close as it gets for me.  These movies are enjoyable all the way through and are those “stranded on an island” movies.. the movies I’d take if I were to be left on some island for years with nothing else to watch but those.  What puts them above something like a 9-9.5 is that these have some personal meaning or something I associate my identity with in addition to just being a good movie.  I don’t give something a 10 right away either.. it takes time for me to know if a movie is in that category, so most of my 10s are older movies",
      "<strong>9-9.5</strong> – Amazing movies, but don’t quite have that personal connection for me.  But otherwise, these are also pretty much a joy to watch from beginning to end.  I’ll re-watch these movies every year or two",
      "<strong>8-8.5</strong> – Really good movies that I plan on watching again.  They have some minor flaws, maybe they drag at some point or they take a wrong turn somewhere, but they are still undeniably good",
      "<strong>7-7.5</strong> – Good but only engaging in bursts.  For me, it’s a movie where I can say “oh I liked that part and that part” or “the cast was good and it was pretty well-made, but I lost interest a little here and there”",
      "<strong>6-6.5</strong> – Above average.  Not really bad, has some merit or entertainment value, but just not really consistently entertaining enough to hold my attention",
      "<strong>5-5.5</strong> – Average.  I didn’t actively dislike it but I would have been fine not having watched it at all.  It’s basically a “competent” movie but that’s about it",
      "<strong>4-4.5</strong> – Below average.  Usually a combination of low quality and bad writing/acting.  Some of these have heart and effort in them but the filmmaking is just not good",
      "<strong>3-3.5</strong> – Bad.  I don’t often go this low unless the movie is just really poorly made, really uninteresting or really dumb",
      "<strong>2-2.5</strong> – Really bad.  These are movies I’m kind of annoyed I even took the time to watch.  I almost never give anything this low of a rating because most movies have some respectable or redeemable aspects to them",
      "<strong>1-1.5</strong> – Unwatchable.  There are probably only a handful of movies I’ve seen in my life that I would go this low on.  They are basically one step above home movies.",
      "<strong>0-0.5</strong> – Doesn’t apply.. I would give every movie at least a 1 for the effort, even if the effort was terrible or misguided",
      "<strong>Watchlists</strong>",
      "For these six-ish months, I made five watchlists:",
      "<li><strong>Halloween 2020</strong> – [<strong>70</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.01</strong>] – The one that started it all.  It was planned as 45 movies with the option to toss in some bonus movies and I tossed in quite a few.  I enjoyed immersing myself in one genre/style of movie at a time for a whole week</li><li><strong>Nov/Dec 2020 </strong>– [<strong>21</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.10</strong>] – This was like a miniature version of the Halloween watchlist, but not so very horror-focused.  I sprinkled in some westerns, action, drama.. but still ended with some Christmas-themed horror</li><li><strong>Gamera</strong> – [<strong>12</strong> movies, avg: <strong>5.58</strong>] – I decided to bite the bullet and just watch ALL of the Gamera movies since I had the full Arrow set.  It was a mix of ok movies with some pretty bad ones</li><li><strong>Randomizer</strong> – [<strong>10</strong> movies, avg: <strong>5.75</strong>] – Wasn’t sure where to go and didn’t have a good idea for a more involved watchlist, so I just made a random generator to pick 10 movies among my unwatched list.  It was an ok experiment but it lacked cohesion  without any themes or categories to follow</li><li><strong>March Madness</strong> – [<strong>32</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.31</strong>] – Another experiment but this one worked out much better.  It’s fun to pit movies against each other and see which ones make it surprisingly far into the bracket</li>",

      "It’s a bit of a bell curve but it really drops off from the 7.5 range to the 8+ range.  A good chunk of the movies are in that 6-7 range.  My theory on why the top of the curve skews towards that range (instead of at 5, the mid-point of the scale) is that these are movies I’ve bought.  While I do blind buy a lot of cheesy/bad movies just for the sake of collecting, I’m still buying movies, mostly horror, that are genres/styles that I already like.  So it’s not like I’m watching Hallmark Christmas movies in these watchlists.",
      "<strong>Top 10</strong>",
      "Out of 145 movies, here are the 10 that really stood out for me:",
      "<li><strong>A Dark Song</strong> – A slow-burn but just really high quality.  The “feel” (or atmosphere or vibe or whatever word I’m using that day) is important to me and this one’s vibe is great</li><li><strong>The Editor</strong> – I <em>just</em> watched this yesterday so maybe my opinion hasn’t had time to fully form, but this was just fun and entertaining with a lot of Easter eggs for horror fans</li><li><strong>Wendigo</strong> – Another more recent watch.  Hard to explain why this one stuck with me, but I guess the realism is one of the main reasons</li><li><strong>Kotoko</strong> – More drama than horror, but it’s still intense.  It’s hard to watch someone in such a bad mental state, but I feel like it was really well-portrayed</li><li><strong>Habit</strong> – More Fessenden.  I mentioned it earlier but it’s an interesting take on destructive habits/relationships</li><li><strong>Hearts in Atlantis</strong> – Great acting and a story that I kind of “get” as a Stephen King/Dark Tower fan</li><li><strong>Ringu</strong> – Not as impactful as it could be since I already knew the major points from the American remake, but still well-made</li><li><strong>Cruising</strong> – If there was a bit more explanation and “glue” in the movie, it would have been one of the top two or three.  It’s basically an American giallo that gets pretty extreme</li><li><strong>Serial Mom</strong> – The more I think about this one, the more fondly I remember it.  Some campy moments, of course, but some pretty hilarious stuff too.</li><li><strong>Phenomena </strong>– It’s got the atmosphere, the music, the actors and a monkey</li>",

      "<li><strong>Devil’s Due</strong> – Cheap found footage, bad acting, unoriginal premise… just nothing appealing to me</li><li><strong>Gamera: Super Monster</strong> – If I hadn’t seen any other Gamera movie, maybe this would be ok as it’s more or less a clip show of older Gamera movies</li><li><strong>Dracula vs Frankenstein</strong> – Just too low budget, low quality, bad acting and kind of incoherent</li><li><strong>The Wasp Woman</strong> – Only a couple minutes of horror and wasp woman near the end.. otherwise it’s a really dull movie</li><li><strong>The Apparition</strong> – I’m not a fan of modern day haunting/supernatural movies and this one is exactly why.  Didn’t like the characters, the acting, the premise</li><li><strong>Brain of Blood</strong> – Really forgettable, but I do remember it was low quality and not very interesting..</li><li><strong>Horror of the Blood Monsters</strong> – Pretty incoherent, just a lot of stuff glued together</li><li><strong>The Invisible Woman</strong> – The poor attempt at comedy here was really tough to watch</li><li><strong>Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation</strong> – If it was actually Christmas-themed, I would have been all right with the movie.. mostly..</li><li><strong>The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</strong> – Gross and unfunny, but I could see kids liking it.  Maybe weird kids</li>",

Twelve of those were just the Gamera set, but I watched some from other collections (Tsukamoto, HG Lewis).  I also got some 80s slashers and gialli out of it</li><li><strong>Scream Factory (Other)</strong> – [<strong>31</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.40</strong>] – I differentiated the Scream Factory category between the Collector’s Editions and the other releases (individuals, box sets, steelbooks).  A lot of these came from the Universal Horror sets as well as the Larry Fessenden set</li><li><strong>Scream Factory (Collector’s Edition)</strong> – [<strong>14</strong> movies, avg: <strong>6.18</strong>] – Not as many as I expected there to be.  I got a lot of the 90s and early 2000s movies from here, as well as a few Hammer</li><li><strong>Severin </strong>– [<strong>11</strong> movies, avg: <strong>4.91</strong>] – Most of these were the Al Adamson set, which is reflected in the low average rating.

I’m looking forward to watching more movies this way and, since I’m constantly buying new ones, I’ll always have more options to draw from.  Time to start working on the next watchlist..",

      "Ahhh… intermission.",
      "We’re at the halfway point (or just past it) after finishing week 5 and having 4 weeks to go, so I thought I’d give some thoughts.  Curious to see how these thoughts will compare to how I feel when the whole watchlist is over at the end of October.",
      "So, first thing’s first.. I already have 39 movies down, which means 14 “bonus” movies.  I didn’t really expect to tackle that many, but most of that is due to how short the Universal horror movies were in the 30s and 40s, so I got 6 bonus movies out of that list.  At this rate, I should end up watching 60-70 movies when it’s all over.  It’s nice catching up on the backlog.",
      "Surprisingly, I’ve probably had the most fun with Week 2 (90s horror).  The 90s is typically considered the worst decade for horror, but I guess the mid-late 90s nostalgia hits me a bit more.  Week 4 (Al Adamson movies) was the weakest, but I don’t think that’s too surprising.  I appreciate his commitment to churning movies out, but they were obviously about piggybacking off of other popular movies to try to make a profit.  But hey, that doesn’t mean they can’t have some entertainment value.",
      "I really enjoy the format of this watchlist, specifically having weekly themes.  I’ve considered having something more like a “daily” theme.  For example, day 1 – Sci Fi, day 2 – 90s, day 3 – Japenese horror, etc.  But it’s really fun immersing yourself in one style or theme for a whole week.  That makes the weeks really distinct, so when you (Future Me) look back on this watchlist, you’ll have very clear memories of various weeks and it won’t all blur together.  You’re welcome.",
      "I’m looking forward to the next few weeks and, even more than that, I’m looking forward to the next time I make a watchlist.  Maybe I’ll feel differently once this watchlist is over and maybe I’ll be ready for a break for a while, but right now, I’m still thinking about other themes I could make for other watchlists.  I guess I don’t have to do horror-only watchlists.. I could have a broader genre watchlist in a couple months but of course Halloween time watchlists will always be my favorite",

      "Oh, hello.  What is this thing?  The whole idea is to make a kind of journal of my first-time viewings of movies, particularly during the Halloween “season” (“season” in quotes because my Halloween season starts in late August..)  I hope to look back on these posts some day and think “oooh yeah, I remember that”.  I guess that’s what journals are all about.. so if you’re reading this Future Me, enjoy this little trip down memory lane.",
      "Ok, just to jog your memory, Future Me, this is the start of <em>my</em> 2020 Halloween season (remember 2020?  wild year).  Since 2018, I’ve made watch lists, mostly around Halloween, as a motivation to watch a lot of the horror (and horror-ish) movies I’ve bought but still haven’t watched.  ",
      "<h2>Halloween 2018</h2>",
      "In 2018, I watched ~30 new movies.  The highlights were <strong>Maniac (2012),</strong> <strong>Madhouse (1981)</strong> and I had a soft spot for <strong>It’s Alive (1974)</strong>.  The lowlights were <strong>The Lazarus Effect (2015)</strong>, <strong>Unfriended (2014)</strong>.  Although the watchlist originally started as a way to track all the “Halloween”-like movies I wanted to make sure to re-watch (the Halloween series, Trick r Treat, that kind of stuff), it turned into a generic horror watchlist.  It turned out to be a fun exercise in watching a variety of films across different eras and sub-genres, so I decided to keep it up each year",
      "<h2>Bonus watchlist: February 2019</h2>",
      "I had a lot of time on my hands around this time, so what better way to spend some of it than with another watchlist (Halloween in February).  Not much to say about that, although I dove into some Italian/Giallo type movies.  <strong>Don’t Torture a Duckling (1972)</strong> was pretty good and it taught me not to torture a duckling.  <strong>Deep Red (1975)</strong> of course was also good.  I also checked out some 70s Japanese horror, but my memory on those is a bit fuzzy (a blog would have helped, huh?)  Aside from that, one notable movie was <strong>Candyman (1992)</strong>, which was all right, but I was expecting something a little different, not so psychological.  With a name like Candyman, I expected something like a candy factory owner who invites kids to see the factory with Golden Tickets, but this wasn’t it.  Maybe someday we’ll get that movie.",
      "<h2>Bonus watchlist: March 2019 Weekly</h2>",
      "I tried something new in March 2019.  My idea was to pick five movies per week and watch them in order, from lowest rated on Letterboxd to highest.  Basically, I’d pick (based on user ratings) a really bad movie, a kind of bad movie, a mediocre movie, an all right movie and a good movie.  The difference this time was that it could be any genre of movie, not just horror.  Of course, I generally preferred the good movies.  My favorites were <strong>Paris, Texas (1984)</strong> and <strong>The Wicker Man (1973)</strong>.. not the Nic Cage one, which, at the time of writing this, I haven’t seen.  Maybe you’ve seen it, Future Me.. maybe you’re looking back at sweet, naive Past You with a longing for a time when you hadn’t seen that movie.",
      "<h2>Halloween 2019</h2>",
      "For Halloween 2019, I watched 34 movies.  None of these movies were particularly memorable to me.  What I do remember was:",
      "<li><strong>Death Valley (1982)</strong> with Ralphie from A Christmas Story</li><li><strong>Chillerama (2011)</strong> which was some weird shit (and not really a movie I’d recommend to people..)</li><li><strong>Braindead (1992)</strong> (or Dead Alive) was a little disappointing for me after hearing so much about it. Maybe I’m just not into the crazier comedy horror stuff</li>",
      "My least favorite of each watchlist were probably the newer ones (post-2010).  Part of that is because I used the watchlist as an excuse to watch a few newer blu-rays I received in the mail through the Horror Pack subscription.. they were disappointing but, hey.. worth a shot.",
      "<h2>Halloween 2020</h2>",
      "Finally, time to talk about 2020.  Wasn’t that the point of this post?  Well anyway, this year, I was pretty eager to get to it.  Start October 1st?  Nah.  Start September 15th?  Nope.  I’m starting August 30th, giving me 9 full weeks until Halloween.  In those 9 weeks, I’ve mapped out a theme for each week, with five movies fitting that week’s theme.  If I’m feeling extra ambitious, I’ve got 2-3 extra movies in each week.. so the goal is to at least watch 45 new movies from my collection (mostly Arrow Video, Scream Factory and Severin).  Who knows, maybe I’ll end up watching 60 new movies by the end of October.. and then I’ll go back into my sad little post-Halloween shell and just wait patiently for 10 months.  So anyway, Future Me, enjoy this blog!",

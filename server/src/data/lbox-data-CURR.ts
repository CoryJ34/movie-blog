Years later, Annie, now an old reclusive, continues to pine after her lost love, even practicing magic rituals in an attempt to bring him back.

Coming to the farm in the wake of her aunt's passing, Annie's niece, Hillie, soon learns from reading her diary that Annie actually believed she'd resurrected Buddy. Sure enough, when some of the youths responsible for driving her aunt to suicide show up looking to cause trouble, a mysterious figure in biker gear appears and begins picking them off one by one.

      "Eddie Weinbauer, a metalhead teen who is bullied at school, looks to his heavy metal superstar idol, Sammi Curr, for guidance. When Curr is killed in a hotel fire, Eddie becomes the recipient of the only copy of Curr's unreleased album, which, when played backwards, brings Sammi back to life. As Halloween approaches, Eddie begins to realize that this isn't only rock 'n roll...it's life and death.",
